Assessor of a military commission to prevent revolutionary disturbances and the intervention of the French Directory in the Papal States, 1796. With the excuse of the assassination of General Duphot on December 28, 1797, in Rome, the French occupied the city on February 10, 1798, and deprived Pope Pius VI of his temporal sovereignty, and proclaimed a Roman Republic. Consalvi was arrested, imprisoned in the Castle S. Angelo, and sent to Civitavecchia en route to Cayenne, French Guiana, but he was returned to S. Angelo, and sent to Terracina. From there, he was allowed to go to Naples. He was permitted by the Neapolitan Government to go to Florence to stay with the pope, who had been sent by the French to the Carthusian monastery in that city. He was allowed to visit the pope twice but was impeded to stay with him by the French envoy in Florence. He went to live in Venice in September 1798.

For his refusal to attend the marriage ceremonies of Emperor Napoléon I Bonaparte and Archduchess Marie Louise of Austria on April 2, 1810, he and twelve other cardinals were deprived of their property and of their cardinalitial dignity and compelled to wear black garments, whence their name of "black cardinals". They were also banished to various French cities and Cardinal Consalvi was sent to Reims together with Cardinal Cesare Brancadoro from June 13, 1810 until the signature of the Concordat of Fontainebleau by Pope Pius VII on January 25, 1813. Freed on January 26, 1813, he joined the pope on February 18, 1813 and recommended that the pontiff retract the concessions made to Napoléon; the retraction of the concordat took place on March 24; as a consequence, Consalvi was restricted in his free access to the pope; he received from the pope the charge of negotiating the restitution of the Papal States. The cardinal was exiled again on January 27, 1814, this time to Bêziers; an order of the French provisional government freed him on April 2, 1814; he left Bêziers on April 20 and rejoined the pope at Rimini on May 8. Emperor Napoleon I had abdicated in Fontainebleau on April 11, 1814.

He left Foligno on May 20, 1814 and arrived in Paris on June 2, too late to take part in the negotiations concerning France; they had been concluded by the first Treaty of Paris, signed on May 30; it confirmed the French possession of Avignon and Comtat Venaissin; he was received by King Louis XVIII, left Paris on June 6 and went to London, where he arrived on June 10, 1814; he was honorably received by the Regent and by Robert Stewart, Lord Castlereagh, foreign secretary; the cardinal requested the restitution of the totality of the Papal States by diplomatic note dated June 23; he returned to Paris on July 9 and remained there until August 20 with the purpose of defending the work of the concordat; he then went to Vienna, where he established himself for nine months starting on September 2, 1814. Participated in the Congress of Vienna from September 1814 to June 9, 1815, when the treaty was signed; the cardinal successfully negotiated the restitution of the legations at the south of the River Po, the Marches, and the enclaves of Pontecorvo and Benevento; a convention signed on June 12, 1815 with Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich determined the conditions for the evacuation of those territories; on June 14, 1815, the cardinal made a solemn protestation against the validity of the treaties of Tolentino of 1797, and Paris of 1814. Cardinal Consalvi returned to Rome on July 2, 1815 and three days later on the 5th of July, retook from Cardinal Pacca his functions as secretary of State; occupied the post until the death of Pope Pius VII. He negotiated concordats or agreements with Bavaria in 1817; with Sardinia also in 1817; with the Two Sicilies in 1818; with Prussia and the princes of the Upper Rhine in 1821; and with Hannover in 1823.

After three months of complete disgrace, the new pope reconciled with the cardinal and named him prefect of the S.C. of Propaganda Fide on January 13, 1824; he died eleven days later. He is considered one of the greatest statesmen ever to serve the papacy.

The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church

Biographical Dictionary
Pope Pius VII (1800-1823)
Consistory of October 20, 1800 (II)
Celebrated in Rome

(3) 1. BORBÓN Y VALLÁBRIGA, Luis María de (1777-1823)
Birth. May 22, 1777, Cadalso de los Vidrios, archdiocese of Toledo, Spain. Son of former Cardinal Luis Antonio Jaime de Borbón y Farnesio (1735) and Maria Teresa de Vallábriga y de Rozas. He was also known as Luis María Vallábriga, count of Chinchón. Because of the "Pragmatic Sanction", his father had given up the last name Borbón.
Education. Studied at the University of Toledo, where he obtained doctorates in theology and canon law in 1794.
Early life. Archdeacon of Talavera, Toledo, 1793.
Priesthood. Granted dispensation to receive ordination being two years under the canonical age and outside the canonical time for ordinations, March 13, 1799.
Episcopate. Elected archbishop of Seville, March 15, 1799. Granted dispensation to receive the episcopal consecration under the canonical age of twenty three years, March 16, 1799. Consecrated, June 2, 1799, Aranjuez, by Cardinal Antonio Sentmanat Cartellá, patriarch of the West Indies; the co-consecrators are not known. Named Grande de España, first class, August 4, 1799. Granted the last name Borbón and the arms of the Royal House, the Order of Charles III, June 1800.
Cardinalate. Created cardinal priest in the consistory of October 20, 1800; received the title of S. Maria della Scala, deaconry elevated pro illa vice to title, October 20, 1800; he was not present in Rome and the red hat, biretta and ring were sent to him. Transferred to the metropolitan and primatial see of Toledo, retaining the administration of the archdiocese of Seville, December 22, 1800. Named marquis of San Martín de la Vega, grand chancellor of Castille, and counselor of State. In 1809, Emperor Napoléon I Bonaparte occupied Spain. The cardinal escaped Toledo and went to Andalucía together with the members of the Junta Central Suprema. At the beginning of 1810, the Junta convoked elections for new Cortes and abolished itself creating a Council of Regency, presided by the bishop of Orsense, January 29, 1810. The Cortes were constituted on September 24 of that same year, in Cádiz. The Council ceded the Cortes the government of the country. Among the many liberal laws issued by the Cortes, the cardinal signed a decree abolishing the Tribunal of the Inquisition. A constitution which all, including the king, had to obey was approved by the Cortes on March 19, 1812. When the president of the Council of Regency refused to sign the constitution, he was expelled from the country and the cardinal, the only member of the royal family present in in Spanish soil, was recognized as regent of the kingdom in August 1812 until the return of Ferdinand VII. On December 11, 1813, Napoléon I accepted defeat in Spain and signed the Treaty of Valençay with Ferdinand VII, recognizing him as king of Spain. On January 6, 1814, a Council of Regency, formed by the cardinal and two generals, was established in Madrid. The Cortes, with a majority of conservatives, met in Madrid on January 14, and did not accept the Treaty of Valençay, or Ferdinand as king, until he swore the Constitution of 1812. On May 4, 1814 a coup restored King Ferdinand VII's absolute power. The cardinal was forced to resign the administration of the archdiocese of Seville, May 19, 1814; the resignation was accepted by the pope, December 29, 1814. After several attempts against the absolute regime of the king, he was forced by Lieutenant Colonel Rafael Riego on March 7, 1820 to accept the constitution of 1812, and a Junta Provisional Consultiva presided by the cardinal (who had already issued a pastoral letter supporting the constitution) was established. For three years, until his death, he presided the junta and was counselor of State.
Death. March 19, 1823, Madrid. Exposed in the metropolitan cathedral of Toledo and buried in the sacristy of that cathedral in a neoclassic sepulchre made of alabaster and sculpted in Rome in 1824 by Valeriano Salvatierra.

Elected to represent the higher clergy of his province at the États généraux, 1789; president of the Assemblé Nationale (formerly États généraux) for fifteen days in November 1789 (1); his wisdom and eloquence made him leader and spokesman of thirty bishops in the assembly; after the adoption in the summer of 1790 of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, which he judged attempted against the rights of the Church, he was replaced by a constitutional bishop in March 1791; it was in this occasion that he addressed to Pope Pius VI, in the name of the episcopate, the famous Exposition de principes sur la constitution civile du clergé of October 30, 1790, a moderate document requesting the advise of the pope, who did not answer. In 1791, he published "Considérations sur la Paix publique adressées aux chefs de la Révolution". From December 1791 until February 1792, he went to Brussels and the to Mainz to visit his family. Returned to Paris and escaped the massacres of September 1792.

He was one of the most remarkable prelates of the 18th century, but the honors that he received after his acceptance of the Concordat of 1801 made him look like a traitor to the refractory bishops, who opposed the settlement.
Death. August 22, 1804, in his maison in Angervilliers. His funeral was celebrated on September 12, 1804. Buried in the cemetery of Angervilliers, then in diocese of Versailles, now in diocese of Evry-Corbeil-Essonnes. At the present, it is not known where his tomb is in that cemetery.

(36) 7. FESCH, Joseph (1763-1839)
Birth. January 3, 1763, Ajaccio, Corsica. Son of Franz Fesch and Angela Maria di Pietrasanta. His father was a Swiss officer at the service of the Genoese navy, who had converted from Protestantism; and his mother had had a daughter from her first marriage to Girolamo Ramolino, Letizia Ramolino, who became the mother of Napoléon Bonaparte. Grand-uncle of Cardinal Lucien-Louis-Joseph-Napoléon Bonaparte (1868).
Education. Initial studies with the former Jesuits (the Society of Jesus had been extinguished) of the Seminary of Ajaccio; continued his studies at the Minor Seminary of Ajaccio from 1778; entered the Grand Seminary of Aix in 1781 (obtained a doctorate in theology, 1785).
Priesthood. Ordained, 1785, Aix. In Ajaccio, he became capitular prebendary in 1787; canon and archdeacon of its cathedral chapter also in 1787; vicar general of the constitutional bishop in 1791; he took the oath of loyalty to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy in that same year and manifested himself in favor of the new order. Obliged to leave Corsica when his family sided with France against the English, who came to the island. Arriving in France, he had to abandon the religious habit; in June 1793, he sought refuge in Provence, with his nephews Joseph, Napoléon and Lucien, where he became a simple store guard; for a while he exiled himself in Switzerland; then, under the protection of his nephew, obtained in 1796, became commissary of war, which contributed to enrich him considerably and allowed him to carry out a rather worldly life. He approached his former state gradually after the 18 Brumaire of year VIII (November 9, 1799); he returned officially to the ecclesiastical state in April 1802, after a retreat in Saint-Sulpice. During the Consulate, became canon of Bastia. Helped, indirectly, to negotiate the Concordat of July 15, 1801 between France and the Holy See.
Episcopate. Nominated by Emperor Napoléon I Bonaparte to the metropolitan see of Lyon, July 31, 1802; accepted by the cardinal legate, Giovanni Battista Caprara, August 4, 1802; confirmed by apostolic brief, September 27, 1802, which also granted him the pallium. Consecrated, August 15, 1802, cathedral of Paris, by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Caprara, assisted by Étienne Bernier, bishop of Orléans, and by Louis Sebastiani, bishop of Ajaccio. He took possession of the see on January 2, 1803.
Cardinalate. Created cardinal priest in the consistory of January 17, 1803; received the red biretta from First Consul Napoléon Bonaparte in the chapel of the Tuileries the following March 27; received red hat, July 7, 1803; and the title of S. Maria della Vittoria, July 11, 1803. Named plenipotentiary minister of the French Republic before the Holy See on April 4, 1803; arrived in Rome on July 2; Chateaubriand was the secretary of the mission. Persuaded Pope Pius VII to go to Paris to crown Napoléon I; accompanied the pope to France and blessed the marriage of Napoléon I and Joséphine before their coronation, December 1, 1804; the coronation took place the following day. He participated in the negotiation of the concordat with the Italian Republic and also took part in the negotiations for a concordat with Germany. He was named senator on February 5, 1804. Named grand chaplain as such, he exerted a great influence on the episcopal nominations) and decorated with the grand aigle of the Légion d'honneur, February 2, 1805. Received the collar of the Spanish order of Toisón de Oro on August 9, 1805. Director of the missionary institutions of Saint-Lazare and Saint-Sulpice, 1805. He had the title of Imperial Highness. Recalled in France in April 1806, not having succeeded in inserting the Holy See in the anti-European coalition, he was appointed, on October 21, 1806, coadjutor of the prince-bishop of Ratisbon, title which did not oblige him with the residence but brought him considerable income, and which was allotted to him because the emperor wished to possibly make of it the primate of Germany as much as that of Gaules. He advised, semi-officially, the emperor on religious matters, which explains why between 1802 and 1812, he made only rare appearances in his archdiocese, remaining there in all for approximately only a year.
He presided over the ecclesiastical commission of 1809 on the application of the Concordat; over that of 1810 on the canonical nomination of the bishops; neither commission adopted any schismatic resolutions; and over the National Council of French bishops of June-October 1811, convened to settle the question of the canonical institution of the bishops apart from the pope by entrusting it to the metropolitans; he was exiled in his archdiocese in March 1812 following the failure of the discussions, the council declaring itself without competence in the matter, and the emperor judging his uncle too close to the Roman positions; he was also deprived on August 26 of the income of Ratisbon and lost the grand chaplaincy. In 1809 and 1810 presided over the two ecclesiastical commissions charged with the question of canonical institution of bishops. On January 31, 1809, he was nominated to the archdiocese of Paris; in February of that same year, he received from the cathedral chapter the powers of capitular administrator; but he declined because he knew that the Holy See would never allow the accumulation of two sees and would not grant the canonical institution. Blessed Napoléon I's marriage with Marie-Louise of Austria. April 2, 1810. He baptized the emperor's son, the king of Rome, on June 9, 1811. As president of the Council of 1811, he remained loyal to Pope Pius VII, in exile at Fontainebleau, and for this, the cardinal fell in disfavor with the emperor. He left his archdiocese in January 1814, because of the advance of the coalition troops, to prevent that a member of the imperial family would fall between their hands; he took refuge in Rome, where he arrived on May 14; he briefly returned to Lyon at the end of May 1815, at the time of the Hundred Days; on June 2, he was named member of the Chambre des Pairs, but he abstained from taking his seat. Prevented from returning to his see by King Louis XVIII, he went back to Rome in August 1815; he was definitively banished from France, like the other members of the imperial family, by the law of January 12, 1816; he always refused, in spite of the papal requests, to resign the archdiocese of Lyon, which he continued to govern through vicars general, although he would have been ready to accept a coadjutor; neither the offer of appointment to archbishop of Ferrara, vacant in 1822, 1826 and 1834, nor that of a suburbicarian, succeeded in convincing him (Pope Pius VII, on October 1, 1817, suspended his jurisdiction and named an apostolic administrator who never took his functions; and Pope Leo XII named a new apostolic administrator on December 26, 1823). He lived in Rome extremely withdrawn, in a palace where his collections accumulated, seeing only his family and remaining far away from the political intrigues. He took part in the work of the congregations to which it belonged (Consistorial, Bishops and Regulars, Council, Propaganda Fide and Ceremonial), and ensured himself, since 1819, of the presence of chaplains in Sainte-Hélène. Opted for the title of S. Lorenzo in Lucina, retaining in commendam the title of S. Maria della Vittoria, December 2, 1822. Cardinal primo prete. Participated in the conclave of 1823, which elected Pope Leo XII. Participated in the conclave of 1829, which elected Pope Pius VIII. Participated in the conclave of 1830-1831, which elected Pope Gregory XVI. More than one thousand paintings of his 17,626 works of art collection are housed at the Fesch Museum, Ajaccio. He succeeded in establishing the harmony between constitutional and refractory priests; supported the reconstitution of the religious communities; started again the interior missions; and restored the public worship. Very conscious of the intellectual failure of the clergy, he attached a particular importance to the revival of clerical studies and to the development of the seminaries, with the result of a considerable increase in the number of priestly ordinations; he conceived, in 1806, the project to associate to the cathedral chapter an École des hautes études, and supported in 1808 the creation of state theological faculties.
Death. May 13, 1839, of stomach cancer, Rome. Exposed in his title, where the funeral took place; transferred to Corneto and buried in the church of the monastery of the Passion in that city, next to his half-sister (1). In July 1851, according to their wills, transported to Ajaccio and in 1860, buried in the crypt of the chapel of his palace. He left important donations to the see of Lyon and to the city of Ajaccio.

The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church

Biographical Dictionary
Pope Pius VII (1800-1823)
Consistory of March 10, 1823 (XVIII)

(86) 1. BERTAZZOLI, Francesco (1754-1830)
Birth. May 1, 1754, Lugo, diocese of Imola. Of a noble family.
Education. University of Bologna, Bologna (doctorate in utroque iure, both canon and civil law; doctorate in theology, October 20, 1778).
Priesthood. Ordained, 1777. In Lugo, professor of theology in its seminary; canon of the collegiate church of Ss. Petronio e Propsero; pro-vicar foraneo; while performing these offices, he met Cardinal Gregorio Barnaba Chiaramonti, O.S.B.Cas., bishop of Imola, future Pope Pius VII, who named him his theologian. In 1796, he tried to calm the insurrection of the citizens of Lugo against the French army and became a member of the council of regency of the city after the Austrian occupation in 1799. He lent the necessary sum of money to Cardinal Chiaramonti to be able to attend the conclave of 1799-1800 in Venice, in which he was elected pope. The new pope offered him the see of Montalto but he declined. Called to Rome on April 10, 1802, the day after the death of Msgr. Gregorio Bandi, who had been chaplain to Pope Pius VI. Entered the service of the Roman Curia as apostolic chaplain before April 24, 1802; and named domestic prelate of His Holiness and canon of the chapter of the patriarchal Liberian basilica before May 1, 1802.
Episcopate. Elected titular archbishop of Edessa in Osrhoëne and named secret almoner of His Holiness, May 24, 1802. Assistant at the Pontifical Throne, May 26, 1802. Consecrated, Sunday May 30, 1802, cathedral of Frascati, by Henry Benedict Mary Stuart, duke of York, bishop of Frascati, assisted by Giovanni Coppola, titular archbishop of Mira, and by Angelo Cesarini, titular bishop of Milevi. Member of the Academy of the Catholic Religion after May 13, 1802; elected its president before January 20, 1808; kept the post until his promotion to the cardinalate. Named again canon of the chapter of the patriarchal Liberian basilica before June 6, 1804. He accompanied the pope in his first trip to France and assisted to the coronation of Emperor Napoléon I Bonaparte on December 2, 1804. Named consultor of the Holy Office before July 23, 1806. Following the French occupation of Rome, he retired to Lugo. Because of his weak character and his influence with Pope Pius VII, he was called to Paris by Napoléon in the Spring of 1811; after long conferences with Cardinal Joseph Fesch, he was to visit the pope, who was prisoner in Savone together with Cardinal Alphonse-Hubert de Latier de Bayane, to negotiate the celebration of a national council in Paris; his influence reopened the possibility of a compromise. In 1811, he was named bishop of Piacenza by the emperor but the appointment remained without effect. He accompanied the pope when he was transferred from Savone to Fontainebleau, June 9 to 19, 1812; he was the sole companion of the pontiff in captivity; it seems that by his advice he influenced the signature of the Concordat of Fontainebleau of January 25, 1813. After the retraction of the concordat by Pope Pius VII on March 24, 1813, he remained at the side of the pontiff and accompanied him in the course of his journey from Fontainebleau to Savone, January 23 to February 16, 1814; and from Savone to Rome, March 19 to May 24, 1814. He entered Rome with the pope, resumed his functions as apostolic chaplain and actively worked in the restoration of the religious enterprise under the direction of Cardinal Bartolomeo Pacca beginning in the Spring of 1814. He was named a member of the congregation for the examination of bishops on May 28, 1814; assessor of the congregation for the examination of disturbances, May 31, 1814; member of the congregation for reform, June 4, 1814; secretary of the congregation for the reforms of studies, December 30, 1814; and again, when it became a cardinalitial congregation, July 22, 1816. Because of strong suspicion on the part of the pope and severe judgement of the part of Cardinals Ercole Consalvi and Pacca, he was not promoted to the cardinalate in the great consistory of 1816. In the Spring of 1816, he contributed the renaissance of the Academy for the Catholic Religion and was named consultor of the S.C. of the Index on July 23, 1816.
Cardinalate. Created cardinal priest in the consistory of March 10, 1823; received the red hat, March 13, 1823; and the title of S. Maria sopra Minerva, May 16, 1823. Participated in the conclave of 1823, which elected Pope Leo XII. Named examiner of bishops in theology, November 7, 1823. Member of the cardinalitial commission for the reform of the pontifical universities, November 23, 1823. Prefect of the new S.C. of Studies, August 28, 1824; the congregation had been established by the apostolic constitution Quod divina sapientia. He became a close friend of Cardinal Mauro Alberto Cappellari, O.S.B.Cam., future Pope Gregory XVI. Protector of the Carmelite Order, July 18, 1826; and of the missions of Ireland, April 3, 1827. Opted for the order of bishops and the suburbicarian see of Palestrina, December 15, 1828. Participated in the conclave of 1829, which elected Pope Pius VIII.
Death. April 7, 1830, Rome, suddenly. Exposed in the church of S. Maria sopra Minerva where the funeral took place on April 14, 1830, and buried in that same church. He named Cardinal Cappellari, O.S.B.Cam., as executor of his will.

(1) According to Tylenda, Jesuit saints & martyrs, p. 249, in 1809, Fr. Giuseppe Pignatelli came to Rome with a small group of Jesuits expelled from the Kingdom of Naples, and after Fr. Odescalchi became acquainted with them, he thought of entering the Society of Jesus. Finally, after Pope Pius VII had restored the Society on August 7, 1814, and it was allowed again to accept new members, Fr. Odescalchi was among the first applicants and was scheduled to enter the Roman novitiate at S. Andrea del Quirinale on November 12, 1814. When his younger sister Vittoria learned of his decision, convinced that she could not live without him near her, she used her influence with Pope Pius VII to intercede on her behalf. Fr. Carlo obeyed the papal wishes and postponed his joining the Society until her future was assured. But when she married three years later, it was the pope himself who did not want to do away with Fr. Carlo when he needed him and, to insure that he would always be at his side, named him to the Sacred Roman Rota.

(1) This is according to Del Re, Monsignor governatore di Roma, p. 123; De Rienzo, "Tiberio Pacca," p. 149, indicates that in a secret accord in the Congress of Vienna, Austria and Naples planned, at the death of Pope Pius VII, to annex the legations to the first one and the Marche to the second. The grave illness of the pope in 1819 accelerated the plan, but he recovered and the protest of the Secretariat of State made public the secret political machinations. Tiberio Pacca, according to this author, sapendose compromesso, knowing that he was compromised in the plan, secretly escaped on the night of April 7, 1820 to avoid arrest. He adds that there were suspicions that Cardinal Consalvi, who appreciated Tiberio, facilitated the escape. It was later reported by those who were not well informed that the reasons had been financial embarrassment, illegal appropriation of money, or the fact that he had illegitimate progeny.
(2) "With his thoughtless escape from the capital, Msgr. Tiberio Pacca, Governor of Rome, Vice-Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church and Director General of the Papal Police, had unfortunately shattered a brilliant career, that had its happy and promising beginning on May 1, 1814, namely, the immediate day after the second restoration of the Papal States, which would have led him in a few years directly to the threshold of the resplendent cardinalate."
(3) After the customary year of vedovanza, widowhood, on September 8, 1838, she married Marquis Luigi Maria Andreassi, from Naples.

Did not accept the Civil Constitution of the Clergy he and went into exile in January 1791 to Sarrebruck and then to Trier; the following year, to Mannheim and finally, to Vienna; because of the threat of war, he retired to Budapest from November 1805 to February 1806; later, to Sternberg in Moravie from May to December 1806. He was named by Louis XVIII, who was also in exile, chargé d' affaires before the imperial Court in 1795 to look after the interests of the French princes and the needs for the emigrants in Austria; he occupied the post until 1808. From 1807 to 1814, he acted as commissary to verify the payment of the pensions to the reprocessed soldiers of the army of Condé; he refused in 1808 to join the king in England (he had taken Austrian citizenship). He did not continue any less to be interested in the affairs of his diocese, asking the Austrian bishops to find places of asylum for its clergy and plead the cause of the Jesuits. He arranged the wedding of the daughter of King Louis XVI to the Duke of Angoulème. He did not resign the government of the diocese as requested by the Concordat of 1801 because he saw in this agreement the absolute decomposition of the old Gallican Church, the sanction of the plundering of the ecclesiastical goods, and the installation of insufficient structures in the pastoral plan; he was charged to transmit the protestation of the bishops from London to Rome; he abstained from any act of jurisdiction and was excluded from the amnesty of the emigrants of April 1802 because of his activities as a royalist agent. In 1808, he became chaplain of Madame Royale, the daughter of King Louis XVI, Marie-Thérèse de France, duchess of Angoulème; he received, on December 19, 1814, the title of first chaplain of the latter, who had become Madame la Dauphine, at the time of the return of the royal family to France. Member of the Royal Privy Council. Returned to France at the end of 1814. In January 1815, he was part of a commission charged with locating, exhuming and transferring the mortal remains of King Louis XVI and Queen Marie-Antoinette. At the request of the king, he resigned secretly (until the new concordat progressed decisively) the government of the diocese, November 15, 1815; the resignation was accepted and published, November 8, 1816. He sought refuge in Gand during the Hundred Days. He was attached to the Grand Chaplaincy by being assistant of the grand chaplain in September 1816; he used his influence to help reach the episcopate several of his condisciples of Saint-Sulpice; and formed part of the commissions charged with helping the emigrants without resources and the new organization of the church of France. Promoted to the metropolitan see of Sens, October 1, 1817 (when the diocese of Auxerre was suppressed, its title was added to Sens, June 3, 1823); received the pallium that same day; he had been nominated by the king of France on August 8; took possession of the see on October 31, 1821; the delay in taking possession has been attributed to difficulties concerning the application of the Concordat of June 11, 1817. Even though he had denounced the Concordat of 1801 and all the acts of Pope Pius VII since 1797, King Louis XVIII refused to name him his ambassador before the Holy See. Duke and peer of the French Kingdom, October 31, 1822.

Created cardinal priest in the consistory of May 16, 1823; received the red biretta by brief of the following May 22; sent by the French king on June 22, 1823; received the red hat, November 20, 1823; and the title of S. Maria in Traspontina, November 24, 1823. Participated in the conclave of 1823, which elected Pope Leo XII. After his promotion to the cardinalate his title of count was changed to that of duke. Minister of State and member of the Privy Council of King Louis XVIII in August 1824. On May 29, 1825, in the metropolitan cathedral of Reims, he delivered the opening sermon of the ceremony of consecration of King Charles X of France.In 1825, he was part of a commission charged with the preparation of the project of a school of the high ecclesiastical studies, coupled with La Sorbonne University, Paris; the project was rejected by a part of the French episcopate in fear of the control of the state over the clerical formation and the Gallican past of the university. Participated in the conclave of 1829, which elected Pope Pius VIII.
Death. Thursday, December 10, 1829, at 4 a.m., château des Tuileries, Paris. Exposed in the church of St. Germain l'Auxerrois, Paris, where the funeral took place on Monday, December 14, 1829, celebrated by Hyacinthe-Louis de Quelen, archbishop of Paris; that same day, the body was translated to Sens and buried in the crypt of the archbishops in the metropolitan cathedral.

The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church

Biographical Dictionary
Pope Leo XII (1823-1829)
Consistory of September 27, 1824 (II)

(3) 1. GAISRUCK, Karl Kajetan von (1769-1846)
Birth. August 7, 1769, Klangefurt, diocese of Gurk, archduchy of Austria. Son of Count Hans Jakob von Gaisruck, president of Carniola (Krain); and later, governor of Eastern Galicia (Ostgalizien) and Baroness Antonia dei Valvassori, dame della Croce Stellata. He was baptized on the same day of his birth. Received the sacrament of confirmation on September 10, 1780. He had the title of count. His first name is also listed as Carlo Gaetano; and his last name as Gaysruck.
Education. First studies at Academia Theresiana in Buda, Hungary; then, as a page at the court of Prince-Archbishop Hieronymus Joseph Franziskus von Colloredo of Salzburg, studied at the local high school; later, he attended Collegium Germanicum, Pavia; and later, he was sent to study at the University of Salzburg, where he earned doctorates in liberal arts and philosophy; he also studied theology and canon law.
Sacred orders. When he was nineteen years old, he entered the ecclesiastical state; Cardinal Franz Auersperg, prince-bishop of Passau, aggregated him to his diocese; received the insignias of the clerical character and minor orders on August 15, 1788; the subdiaconate on December 26, 1795; and the diaconate on December 23, 1797. Elected canon of the cathedral chapter of Passau, September 15, 1788; and capitular vicar in 1797.
Priesthood. Ordained, July 6, 1800, by Leopold Leonhard von Thun, prince-bishop of Passau. Pastor of Sankt Martin, Kallham, diocese of Linz.
Episcopate. Elected titular bishop of Derbe and appointed suffragan of Passau, July 20, 1801. Consecrated, Sunday August 23, 1801, Passau, by Leopold Leonhard von Thun, prince-bishop of Passau (no information found about the co-consecrators). In 1803, the bishopric of Passau was secularized and the prince-bishop and his coadjutor could no longer live there. Bishop Gaisruck then took care of the parish of Kalham, in the diocese of Linz and worked earnestly to alleviate the dire consequences of the Austro-French war that was fought in its territory. Emperor Franz II nominated him for the metropolitan see of Milan on March 1, 1816, without the previous agreement of the Holy See, which delayed his promotion for two years. The see of Milan had united to it the title of cappellano della Corona del Lombardo-Veneto (1).The archdiocese had been vacant since de death of Cardinal Giovanni Battista Caprara on June 21, 1810. Promoted by the pope to that see on May 16, 1818. The new archbishop constituted an episcopal council, composed of twelve priests to assist him in the reorganization and reform of the archdiocese. He reorganized the clergy, about 2000, that included several hundred foreigners and politicians, who were forced to live in ways that were not acceptable for lack of positions that provided them with the necessary means. The archbishop ordered a moral census of the priests and incardinated the best; sent to the diocese of origin the undisciplined; established homes for the old and the sick; and for the future, closed the doors to strangers. To have a clergy that was homogeneously formed, Archbishop Gaisruck reorganized the seminaries: he opened the minor seminary of S. Pietro Martire in 1818, replacing the one in Castello, above Lecco, that had become insufficient; and in Monza, in the old locale of the convent of S. Francesco, which was rebuilt and adapted, was opened the seminary for middle students. He resolved the dispute between the government of Milan, the Court of Vienna and the Swiss Confederation, concerning Collegio Elvetico, founded by St. Charles Borromeo in Milan, and suppressed by Napoléon Bonaparte on June 7, 1797, by proposing a settlement that gave the Swiss twenty three places at the expense of the state exchequer in the seminars in Milan in 1835; he also reformed and introduced new disciplines in the school curriculum such as mathematics, physics and ecclesiastical history; he endowed seminaries of a faculty distinguished for their knowledge and piety; and strongly opposed any government interference in the seminaries. Between 1823 and 1841, he had published four editions of the Breviario Ambrosiano.
Cardinalate. Created cardinal priest in the consistory of September 27, 1824; received the red biretta from the emperor on February 3, 1825. Participated in the conclave of 1829, which elected Pope Pius VIII. Received the red hat on May 18, 1829; and the title of S. Marco on May 21, 1829. Participated in the conclave of 1830-1831, which elected Pope Gregory XVI. His charity became particularly evident in 1833, during the cholera epidemic that affected the archdiocese. In 1837, for the clergy, he had Father Luigi Biraghi prepare the Catechismus Ordinandorum ad usum Dioecesis Mediolanensis. Decorated with the grand cross of the Austrian Order of Sankt Stefan, 1838. Arrived at the conclave of 1846 bringing the veto of the emperor of Austria-Hungary, recommended by Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich, foreign minister of the Austrian Empire, against the election of Cardinal Giovanni Maria Mastai Ferretti, but Cardinal Mastai Ferretti had already been elected and taken the name Pius IX (2). The cardinal was late because of health problems. In mid-November 1846, he solemnly received the viaticum; and on November 18, he was administered the last rites, serenely dying the following day. In his will, he had left all his possession to the archdiocese of Milan, including 1500 works that he gave to the library of the major seminary.
Death. November 19, 1846, Milan. Exposed and buried in the south nave, in front of the altar of S. Agata, in the of the metropolitan cathedral of Milan.

Consecrated, July 3, 1796, Rome, by Cardinal Giacinto Sigismondo Gerdil, B., assisted by Nicola Buschi, titular archbishop of Efeso, and by Michele Di Pietro, titular bishop of Isauriopoli. Took possession of the see in the following month of September. He demonstrated excellent pastoral skills in those difficult years, doing everything for the people, put to the test by the war between the French and the Austrians. When the inhabitants of Casale Monferrato rebelled against the French and the city was threatened with destruction, Bishop Ferrero intervened and the massacre was avoided; he was imprisoned and sent to Alessandria. He was released and returned to Casale and began to revive and help the population. During the French occupation, he welcomed Pope Pius VI, a prisoner of the French Revolution, and accompanied him to Turin. Resigned pastoral government of the diocese, May 18, 1803. Emperor Napoléon Bonaparte obtained from Pope Pius VII the reduction of the dioceses of Piedmont, therefore, with papal bull of June 1, 1803, were suppressed nine dioceses including Casale Monferrato, Pinerolo, Fossano, Susa, Biella, Aosta, Alba, Testona, and Bobbio. By virtue of that decree, the diocese of Saluzzo was united with the suppressed diocese of Pinerolo. Bishop Ferrara was nominated bishop of Saluzzo by the emperor on June 11, 1805. The pope transferred him to that see on February 1, 1805, in the consistory celebrated in Paris. Bishop Ferrero administered the diocese of Saluzzo, staying in Casale Monferrato until the day of the solemn entrance in Saluzzo. He worked to obtain that Cardinal Bartolomeo Pacca and other Roman prelates had less harsh living conditions in the period in which they were exiled and imprisoned in the fortress of Fenestrelle. The emperor, even knowing the bishop's opposition to his government, appointed him knight of the Légion d'honneur; and baron of the empire in 1808. In 1815, he met Pope Pius VII in Turin on the occasion of the display of the Holy Shroud. He established the episcopal seminary of Saluzzo in the church of S. Nicola and the annexed convent. He also established the residence of the bishops in the former palace of the counts of Cravetta. Resigned pastoral government of the diocese, April 9, 1824. Abbot commendatario of the abbey of S. Benigno di Fruttuaria, 1824. At the request of King Carlo Felice he was promoted to the cardinalate.
Cardinalate. Created cardinal priest in the consistory of September 27, 1824; he never went to Rome to receive the red hat and the title. Did not participate in the conclave of 1829, which elected Pope Pius VIII. Did not participate in the conclave of 1830-1831, which elected Pope Gregory XVI. He retired first to Villanovetta; and later, to S. Benigno di Fruttuaria. He died in poverty, after a life spent helping the poor and the suffering.
Death. December 30 (or 31), 1831, Turin, abbatial palace of S. Benigno di Fruttuaria. Exposed and buried in the abbatial church of S. Benigno (1).

LAMENNAIS, Robert Hugues-Félicité de (1782-1854)
Birth. June 29, 1782, at 5 rue Saint-Vincent, Saint-Malo, Brittany, France. One of the six children of Pierre Robert de Lamennais, a successful merchant ennobled by King Louis XVI of France at the request of the Estates of Brittany in recognition of his public services, and Gratienne Lorin. He was intended by his father to follow a mercantile career. Hs brother Jean-Marie also entered the priesthood. His last name is also listed as La Mennais; and his first name as Hugues Félicité Robert.
Education. His mother died in 1787 and his father entrusted the education of his two sons to Robert des Saudrais, his wife's brother-in-law. The two children went to live with their uncle at La Chjnaie, an estate near Saint-Malo. There was a good library in the estate with works of piety and theological books were mingled with the ancient classics and the works of the eighteenth-century philosophers. When Félicité misbehaved, he was sent to the library and thus, he developed a great interest in the books he found in the library and read voraciously and indiscriminately all that came to his hands. He looked for reasons to be sent to the library, dedicated himself there to his readings, and made such rapid progress that he was soon able to read the classical authors without difficulty. He completed his literary education and acquired foreign languages; since he studied without teachers or guidance, this produced gaps in his training, and gave him an inclination to intellectual intolerance.
Early life. The French Revolution had forced numerous priests to leave the country or to go underground. The Lamennais family offered assistance to one of those priests, Abbé Vielle. Félicité assisted him in the celebration of mass and acquired a strong dislike for the Revolution. At the same time, because of his reading without guidance, he was prejudiced against religion and this made his confessor to postpone indefinitely his first communion. The influence of his brother Jean Marie, who was ordained to the priesthood in 1804, helped him to restore his Christian sentiments, which allowed him to receive his first communion. That same year, he decided to dedicate himself to the service of the church and in La Chênaie, under the direction of Fr. Jean-Marie, did his ecclesiastical studies from 1806. In 1808, together with his brother, he published the book Réflexions sur l'état de l'Église en France pendant le dix-huitieme siècle et sur sa situation actuelle. Many of the views expressed in the book offended the imperial government and it was suppressed by the police; not until the fall of the empire it was republished. In 1811 he received the tonsure. The Lamennais brothers were appointed professors at the College de Saintt-Malo; Filiciti taught mathematics; his father's business having been ruined by the Continental Blockade, he had to make a living; when the college was closed by imperial authority, Filiciti returned to La Chjnaie and Jean-Marie became vicar general of the diocese of Saint-Brieuc. Filiciti, again with the collaboration of his brother, completed a work, printed and published in Paris in 1814, in which he opposed Napoleon's plans to give to the metropolitan archbishops the canonical instuitution of bishops at the expense of the papal authority. This work was the starting point of Lamennais' stance against Gallicanism. During the Hundred Days, he went to England; he was assisted there by Fr. Carron, a French priest who had established in London a school for the children of émigrés. When the last Napoleonic adventure was over, he returned to France and continued his friendship with Fr. Carron, who had also gone back to Paris; the example of this priest and the counsel of the Sulpitian Fr. Beysserre, helped him decide to be ordained a priest; he had to overcome strong doubts and hesitations. In 1815, in Paris, he lived in a dependence of the convent of Feuillantines; at the same time, young Victor Hugo resided there with his mother and his brother.
Priesthood.Ordained, March 9, 1817. Towards the end of the same year, 1817, the first volume of the Essai sur l'indifférence en matière de religion was published; its second volume appeared in 1820; and the last two volumes in 1823. From 1818 to 1820 he collaborated in the paper Conservateur, founded by François René, viscount of Chateaubriand; it ceased publication when the censorship of the press was again established in March 1820. He founded Le Défenseur in 1820 with Louis de Bonald, Alphonse-Marie-Louis de Lamartine, Charles Nodier and other collaborators. In 1828, he founded the Congrégation de Saint-Pierre (1), intended to form a clergy erudite, able to answer to the attacks of the philosophers, to better understand its time and to restore the authority of the pope in France. He began a remarkable campaign against Gallicanism and anti-Christian philosophy and soon became the most celebrated French cleric of the time and was the most open advocate of ultramontanism in France for many years. He believed that the church could have no real liberty under a royal government and that free speech and a free press were essential. The criticisms of the Essai irritated Fr. Lamennais but did not convince him that it contained any errors; he submitted the book to Rome and, to reply to his critics, he wrote the Défense de l'Essai in 1821. Rome limited its response to granting its imprimatur to an Italian translation of the Essai. Fr. Lamennais visited the Holy See and Pope Leo XII received him very kindly.
Cardinalate. According to his biographical entry in The Catholic Encyclopedia, Pope Leo XII thought of elevating him to the cardinalate, in spite of his inflammable character and extreme positions; but the promotion never came to happen. The last of his biographies in English linked below says that Pope Leo XII offered him the cardinalate and that he refused the promotion.
Later life. On October 16, 1830, he founded the newspaper L'Avenir and asked for freedom of conscience, press and religion. His work in the newspaper created a sensation, and he was soon entangled with the conservative, royalistic Gallicans among the clergy. He also founded the General Agency for the Defense of Religious Liberty. In 1831, along with Jean-Baptiste-Henri Dominique Lacordaire and Charles-Forbes-René, count de Montalembert, he went to Rome to submit his quarrel with the Gallican clergy to Pope Gregory XVI, but, without expressly designating Fr. Lamennais, the pope condemned in the encyclical Mirari vos of August 15, 1832 some of the ideas advanced in L'Avenir such as liberty of the press, liberty of conscience, revolt against princes and the need of regenerating Catholicism; Fr. Lamennais opposed the pope arguing that the pontiff supported the princes more than the people. He submitted to papal authority towards the end of 1833; he soon recanted his submission. The publication in 1834 of his book Paroles d'un croyant sealed his rupture with the Catholic Church; in his work, he launched a pressing and prophetic call to the freedom of the Church and developed the socialist and democratic tendencies with its message evangelic; his friends left him little by little. The pope explicitly condemned Fr. Lamennais in his encyclical Singulari Nos, dated June 25, 1834, which also condemned the Liberal Catholic movement. After that, he retired for two years and appeared in public as a non-Christian. He continued to take the side of the people and because of his attacks on the royal government, in 1841 he spent one year in prison in Sainte-Pélagie, accused of conspiration; he was condemned in spite of the support of Chateaubriant and George Sand, who were very impressed by his political engagement; imprisonment did not change his views. When Pope Pius IX was elected in 1846, Lamennais did not follow the suggestion of some liberal Catholics to enter the church again. When the Revolution of 1848 happened, he was elected deputy in April of that year, by 104,811 votes, to the last seat given to Paris; he was named a member of the committee to prepare the new constitution; he advocated universal suffrage, universal free education, progressive taxation; an end to the monopoly of the university and the separation of church and state; and opposed a strongly centralized government, and called for local liberties; he resigned his post the following May, disappointed by the behavior of certain fellow-members who opposed local freedoms in particular. After the revolutionary days of June 1848, he closed his newspaper, Le Peuple constituant, which had been published from February 27 to July 11. He considered that the repression which followed made shame to the Second French Republic. He withdrew again to his property of Chesnay in Brittany. Legal action was taken against Lamennais, and in October the paper was condemned and he was fined; he joined representatives of the left to support the presidential candidacy of Alexandre-Auguste Ledru-Rollin, and wrote forty-three articles for the democratic-socialist La Réforme in 1849, before the paper ceased publication on January 12, 1850. Later, Lamennais condemned the coup of Louis Napoleon. He was the leading Catholic thinker of Restoration in France as well as the first proponent of Liberal Catholicism and an early advocate of social Catholicism. His eventual advocacy of a conciliation between Catholicism and Liberalism led to his rupture with the Church.
Death. February, 27, 1854, Paris; on his deathbed he refused to see a priest and died without having reconciled with the Church. On March 1, 1854, he was buried, as he had requested, in an unmarked common grave in the cemetery of Père-Lachaise, Paris. He also refused to have religious obsequies. The workers and the Marseillaise accompanied his casket.

(1) This is according to Ritzler, Hierarchia Catholica Medii et Recentioris Aevi, VII, 21, n. 51; the same source, VII, 21, says that he died on February 18, 1829 If he had died on the latter day, it would have been two days after the beginning of the 1829 conclave and he is not mentioned at all in its chronicle in the same source, VII, 22; "L'ami de la Religion" not only gives January 18, 1829 as the date of his death but published it on the issue of February 7, 1829 thus making it impossible that the cardinal would have died on the following February 18; Boutry, Souverain et Pontife, p. 313, also says the he died on January 18, 1829.

LINGARD, John (1771-1851)
Birth. February 5, 1771, Winchester, England. Son of Lincolnshire yeomen. He was baptized on the following day.
Education. Studied at the English College, Douai, France, from September 30, 1782; appointed a doctor of theology and of utroque iuris, both civil and canon law, by Pope Pius VII in 1821.
Priesthood. Escaped to England because of the French Revolution, and in May, 1794 was charged with the caring of a group of Douai refugees, becoming professor of philosophy, vice-president, prefect of studies, procurator, and professor of church history. Thus, he was one of the founding fathers of Ushaw College (the descendant of the English College, Douai). Ordained, April 18, 1795, York. Declined the presidency of Maynooth College, 1811, went to Hornby, a country mission about eight miles from Lancaster, where he was the resident Catholic priest for forty years, until his death in 1851. In a visit to Rome in the spring of 1817, he successfully negotiatiated the restablishment of English College. Declined the title and dignity of monsignor as "too foreign", 1821. His sympathies were somewhat cisalpine, as the English preferred to call Gallicanism. He was a central figure in the English Catholic Enlightenment and his History of England, was a model of scholarly erudition in his time. Throughout his life he was a trusted advisor of the English hierarchy. He was an associate of the Royal Society of Literature and in 1839, a corresponding member of the Académie Française.
Cardinalate. It had been generally believed, until Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman, archbishop of Westminster, contradicted it many years later, in his Recollections of the last four popes and of Rome in their times, that Pope Leo XII, in the consistory of October 2, 1826, had created Fr. Lingard cardinal in pectore, postponing the publication until he could finish his History of the Anglo-Saxon Church and be free to go to Rome. The cardinal considered that the French theologian François de Lamennais was the secret cardinal. A controversy between Canon Mark Aloysius Tierney (Was Dr. Lingard actually a cardinal? To the editor of the Rambler) and Cardinal Wiseman followed the publication of the cardinal's book. Although the matter was almost impossible to ascertain, Canon Tierney seemed to have had the strongest reasons in the controversy. Fr. Lingard's own words seemed to confirm his secret promotion: "Whatever I might have done twenty years ago", he wrote on January 27, 1829 to John Bradley, a priest at Ushaw, "I should now feel extremely unwilling to go to Rome, and there have to undergo all the fuss and parade, and ceremony of a cardinal's life." In a letter to John Walker, dated September 14, 1840, he wrote referring to Pope Leo XII, "...he made me a cardinal in petto, he described me in his consistory as not one of the servile pecus of historians, but one who offered the world historiam ex ipsis haustam fontibus".
Death. July 17, 1851, Hornby. Buried, cemetery cloister, Ushaw.

Resigned pastoral government of the diocese of Tivoli on April 24, 1827. Promoted to the titular see of Larissa on May 21, 1827.

Clemente on August 1, 1834. When his promotion to the cardinalate was published, the Collegio dei teologi of Perugia, of which the new cardinal was a member, celebrated a solemn pontifical in the cathedral with the participation of Bishop Carlo Silesio Cittadini of Perugia and of the apostolic delegate, Antonio Maria Cagiano de Azevedo, future cardinal. The collegio decided to send him a dedicatory letter accompanying Latin allocution by Perugine poet Francesco Maturanzio written on the occasion of the promotion to the cardinalate of Francesco della Rovere, future Pope Sixtus IV. Because of delays in the printing, when the work was ready, the news of the death of the cardinal arrived in Perugia.
Death. April 11, 1835, after a very brief illness, in Rome. His brother Luigi was not able to arrive in Rome before the cardinal died in spite of his prompt departure. Exposed in the church of S. Marcello, Rome, where the funeral took place; and buried in the subterranean of his title, S. Clemente (2). In Perugia, a solemn funeral was celebrated in the cathedral with music by celebre composer Francesco Morlacchi. The funeral eulogy was delivered on May 12, 1834 in the cathedral of S. Lorenzo by Canon Luigi Mattioli, his old condisciple, and published in Perugia in that same year by Collegio dei teologi.

(8) 8. NEWMAN, Orat., John Henry
(1801-1890)
Birth. February 21, 1801, London, England. The eldest of the six children of John Newman, a banker, and Jemina Foundrinier, a descendent of the Huguenots who migrated from France after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. The other siblings were Charles, Francis, Harriet, Jemima and Mary. Baptized in the Church of England, April 9, 1801. He converted to Calvinism at the age of 15, August-December, 1816.
Education. Trinity College, Oxford, 1816-1822; elected a fellow at Oriel College, Oxford, April 12, 1822; ordained to the diaconate, June 13, 1824; curate of St. Clement's, Oxford, 1824-1826; ordained priest of the Church of England, May 29, 1825, Christ Church, Oxford; vice-principal at St. Mary's Hall, 1825; vicar of St. Mary's (also the university church), 1828. resigned his tutorship, 1832 and went on a trip around the Mediterranean (December, 1832-July, 1833); returned to Oxford. With the Assize sermon on "National Apostasy" by John Keble, on July 14, 1833, the Oxford Movement was born. The religious opinions and principles of the Movement toward High Church principles in opposition to liberalizing and evangelical tendencies and emphasizing the principles of primitive and patristic Christianity as well as the historic and catholic character of the church, were given in a series of 90 papers called the Tracts for the Times, published in Oxford from 1833 to 1841. Newman became the leader of the Tractarian Movement, as it was also known. Resigned from St. Mary's in 1843. On October 9, 1845 he converted to Catholicism and was received into the Church in Littlemore by Fr. Domenico Barberi, an Italian Passionist (1). On November 1, 1845, he received the sacrament of confirmation and added Mary to his given name.
Priesthood. Ordained, May 30, 1847, Rome, by Cardinal Giacomo Filippo Fransoni. Returned to England in 1847 and, encouraged by Pope Pius IX, established the Oratory of St. Philip Neri; set up the London house and began mission work in Birmingham; later moved to Edgbaston.

He opposed that the First Vatican Council (1869-1870) would issue a document of papal infallibility. He was not opposed to the concept but felt that the doctrine should be given more time to mature before it was codified. Once the doctrine was proclaimed, he strongly defended it. For many years he endured attacks and criticism from within and without the Church. Returned to Oxford as honorary fellow of Trinity College, February, 1878.
Cardinalate. Created cardinal deacon in the consistory of May 12, 1879; received the red hat and the deaconry of S. Giorgio in Velabro, May 15, 1879. His motto as a cardinal was Cor ad cor loquitur, which was inspired by letters of St. Francis de Sales, bishop of Généve, Switzerland, for whom the cardinal had a great admiration and devotion and whose picture the cardinal had presiding his private chapel in the Oratory of Birmingham. The most famous and illustrious English convert, his life and thought are well documented through 21,000 of his personal letters that have survived as well as the 40 books that he published.
Death. Monday August 11, 1890, of pneumonia, in Edgbaston, Birmingham, England. Exposed in the Oratory of St. Philip of Edgbaston; and buried, on the following day, in the small secluded cemetery at the Oratory House, Rednal, near Birmingham; in the same tomb with Fr. Ambrose St. John (+ 1875), according to his wishes. A plaque commemorates him in the church of S. Giorgio in Velabro, his deaconry (2).
Beatification. The cause for his beatification was opened in 1958. Pope John Paul II signed the document acknowledging he practiced the Christian virtues in a heroic degree and declared him Venerable, January 22, 1991. At the beginning of 2008, in preparation for his beatification, the Vatican requested that his remains be transferred to the chapel of the Oratory of Birmingham and placed in a marble sarcophagus so that the faithful can venerate them more easily (3). On July 3, 2009, the pope authorized the publication of the decree of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints concerning a miracle attributed to his intercession. In a ceremony celebrated on September 19, 2010, in Birmingham, England, Pope Benedict XVI declared him a blessed.

(1) Fr. Domenico Barberi , C.P. (1792-1849) was beatified by Pope Paul VI on October 27, 1963.
(2) A statement at the website of the archdiocese of Birmingham, England, says: The tomb was excavated with the utmost care on Thursday October 2, 2008. During the excavation the brass inscription plate which had been on the wooden coffin in which Cardinal Newman had rested was recovered from his grave. It reads: 'Eminent [issimus] et Reverend [issimus] Joannes Henricus Newman Cardinalis Diaconus S Georgii in Velabro Obiit Die XI August. MDCCCXC RIP'. This is its translation into English: 'The Most Eminent and Most Reverend John Henry Newman Cardinal Deacon of St George in Velabro Died 11 August 1890 RIP'. "Brass, wooden and cloth artefacts from Cardinal Newman's coffin were found. However there were no remains of the body of John Henry Newman. An expectation that Cardinal Newman had been buried in a lead lined coffin proved to be unfounded. "In the view of the medical and health professionals in attendance, burial in a wooden coffin in a very damp site makes this kind of total decomposition of the body unsurprising. "The absence of physical remains in the grave does not affect the progress of Cardinal Newman's Cause in Rome. "The Birmingham Oratory has always been in possession of some actual physical remains of Cardinal Newman. These consist of some locks of hair. "These together with items found in his grave, will be housed in a casket for a Vigil of Reception on Friday 31 October and Saturday 1 November, to be followed by High Mass on the Feast of All Souls, Sunday 2 November, at 11.00 am, when the casket will be placed in the Oratory Church, Edgbaston." Although not mentioned in any of his writings, a local contemporary newspaper reporting his death indicated that the cardinal had requested that an acid subtance that would accelerate the decomposition of his body be spread over his coffin.

The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church

Biographical Dictionary
Pope Leo XIII (1878-1903)
Consistory of December 13, 1880 (III)

(15) 1. HASSOUN, Andon Bedros
(1809-1884)
Birth. June 15, 1809, Constantinople, Ottoman Empire. From a noble family. His last name is also known as Hasoun, or Hasounean, or Hassun. He is also listed as Antoine-Pierre IX Hassoun; as Antonio Pietro IX Hassun; and as Anton Petros IX Hassounian.
Education. Initial studies in Constantinople; in 1822, he went to Rome and studied at the Seminary of S. Pietro in Vaticano; and at the Pontifical Urban Athenaeum of Propaganda Fide, where he obtained a doctorate in theology in 1832.
Priesthood. Ordained, September 8, 1832. He was assigned to Smyrna, where he was placed in charge of the Armenian Catholic parish. Later, he was called to Constantinople, where he worked in several parishes and became chancellor and vicar general of the primatial see.
Episcopate. Elected titular archbishop of Anazarbo and appointed coadjutor, with right of succession, of the metropolitan and primatial see of Constantinople of the Armenians, June 7, 1842. The election was made according to a decree of the S.C. of Propaganda Fide, dated May 9, 1842, which was approved by the pope the following May 23 without the habitual consultation with the people and the clergy. Consecrated, June 19, 1842, church of the S.C. of Propaganda Fide, Rome, by Cardinal Giacomo Filippo Fransoni, prefect of the S.C. of Propaganda Fide, assisted by Ignazio Giovanni Cadolini, titular archbishop of Edessa di Osroene, secretary of the S.C. of Propaganda Fide, and by Joseph Rosati, C.M., bishop of St. Louis, Missouri, United States of America. Succeeded to the metropolitan and primatial see of Constantinople of the Armenians, August 2, 1846; as primate, he had jurisdiction over Grand Armenia, Asia Minor, the region of Constantinople and European Turkey; his elevation provoked a strong discontent in the Armenian community, which was jealous of its traditional privileges in the election of bishops. He was also civilian Armenian prelate but he renounced the title (which was a civil servant and the only official contact between the Sublime Porte and Catholics, and allowed him at the same time to combine religious power and civil power) in 1848, to avoid discord; he resumed the title in 1860. Assistant at Pontifical Throne, February 15, 1859. Elected by the Armenian Synod of Bzommar (1) patriarch of patriarch of Cilicia of the Armenians (with residence in Lebanon) on September 14, 1866. Took the name Andon Bedros IX. On July 12, 1867, by the papal bull Reversurus, the primatial see and the patriarchate were united and the patriarchate was transferred to Constantinople; the bull also amended the rules relating to the election of bishops; these decisions provoked a schism (2). On July 12, 1867, he was also granted the pallium. Participated in the First Vatican Council, 1869-1870; he was member of the Dogmatic Commission, and ranked among the supporters of the definition of papal infallibility. The excommunication pronounced by Pope Pius IX against the schismatics on June 14, 1872, produce the expulsion in July of the patriarch by the government; the patriarch sought refuge in Rome. The Sultan of Turkey, under pressure from France, recognized in 1874 the Church that had remained faithful to Rome as a different one from the schismatic Church and the patriarch was able to return to Constantinople in 1876. On April 18, 1879, the schismatics reconciled with the Holy See and, to facilitate the pacification, the patriarch was called to Rome in 1880. He was a very active pastor: he founded a seminary in Constantinople; built several churches and schools; established better relations with the civil power; in 1843, he founded the Congregation of the Armenian Sisters of the Immaculate Conception; in 1850 created six new bishoprics in the primatial province as well as a new Armenian bishopric in Persia; and encouraged missionary activity among the schismatic Armenians. His willingness to Romanize and Latinized his Church and his centralizing policy, contrary to the ancient privileges of the Armenian Church, were among the causes of the schism.
Cardinalate. Created cardinal priest in the consistory of December 13, 1880; received red hat and title of Ss. Vitale, Gervasio e Protasio, December 16, 1880. He was named member of the SS. CC. of Propaganda Fide for the Affairs of Oriental Rites, Index, Rites and Ceremonial. He resigned the patriarchate in June 1881. He contributed to the foundation of the Pontifical Armenian College, which is the Armenian seminary in Rome, located next to the church S. Nicola da Tolentino agli Orti Sallustiani and in charge of the latter. He was the first prelate of Oriental rite created cardinal since the promotion of Cardinal Bessarion (1439).
Death. February 28, 1884, at 1:00 a.m., in his residence in via degli Angeli Custodi, Rome, from a pleuropneumonia, after receiving the viaticum the extreme unction and the apostolic blessing. Present was his secretary of 23 years, Monsignor Pasquale Rubian. Upon learning of the death of the cardinal, Patriarch Stepan Bedros X Azarian of Cilicia of the Armenians sent a telegram of condolence; and in another telegram, the patriarch, the bishops and the faithful asked that the body of the late cardinal be transferred to Constantinople; apparently, this request was never fulfilled. Exposed in the church of S. Andrea delle Fratte, Rome, on March 1, 1884; the funeral mass took place on Tuesday March 4 at 10:30 a.m. in that church and was celebrated by Vincenzo Leone Sallua, O.P., titular archbishop of Calcedonia; Cardinal Jean-Baptiste-François Pitra, bishop of Frascati, imparted the final absolution; present were Cardinals Angelo Bianchi, Lorenzo Ilarione Randi, Angelo Jacobini, Tommaso Zigliara, O.P., Edward Henry Howard of Norfolk, Giovanni Simeoni, Pietro Lasagni, Enea Sbarreti and Luigi Oreglia di Santo Stefano; as well as the ambassador of the Sultan of Turkey before Italy, Musurus Bey; and the Ottoman consul-general in Rome, Carlo Galian Effendi. The late cardinal was buried in the chapel of the Fathers Minimos of S. Francesco di Paola, Campo Verano cemetery, Rome. Other funerals were celebrated at the Pontifical Armenian College and at the Pontifical Urban Athenaeum of Propaganda Fide. There is a memorial in the right side of the chapel of Saint Gregory the Illuminator, in the Armenian church of S. Nicola da Tolentino agli Orti Sallustiani, Rome; his cardinalitial hat hangs from the ceiling of that church.

(2) These two events greatly contributed to exacerbate divisions within the Armenian Catholic community, and the failure of the synod convened at Constantinople in July 1869, led a portion (about one third) of the Armenian Church to form, on April 3, 1870, while the Patriarch attended the First Vatican Council in Rome, to form, supported by the Turkish government (which feared the disturbance of public order), a schismatic Church, citing the violation of traditional rights. The schism provoked disputes over the ownership of churches, schools and welfare institutions.

In 1888, at the invitation of Pope Leo XIII, he launched the campaign to end slavery in Africa. He knew that to get the governments to do so he had to mobilize public opinion in Europe. With that goal in mind, he visited the capitals of Europe, giving conferences in Saint Sulpice, Paris; Princes Hall, London; the church of Saint Gudule, Brussels; and the church of the Gesù, Rome. He drew peoples attention to the fact that the victims of African slavery were especially women and children, appealing in particular to the women in his audiences to pressure their governments to change the situation. The cardinal not only called on all Christians to engage in this campaign, he also appealed to those in the wider community too, and all this effort contributed greatly to getting European governments to eliminate slavery in Africa. Named apostolic administrator of the vicariate of Sahara on March 13, 1891.
Death. November 26, 1892, at 1 a.m., in Algiers. Funerals took place in Algiers, Tunis and Carthage. The body was taken to Tunis and deposited in the vault prepared for him in the crypt of the metropolitan cathedral of Carthage on the hill of Byrsa on December 8, 1892. In 1964, when the cathedral became the property of the government, his remains were transferred to Rome and buried in the crypt of the chapel of the Society of Missionaries of Africa's general curia (1).

(1) This is according to his biography in the site of the archdiocese of Dublin, linked above:
Edward McCabe was Archbishop of Dublin for only six years. In the 1870s, severe economic depression was a major factor in Ireland. As a result a new agrarian movement, the Land League, came into being. Initially the Irish Catholic clergy supported the agitation and came to play a prominent role at local level. On Sunday 4 January 1880, a collection was made in aid of the distressed districts of Ireland at chapels in the Dublin Diocese. As the movement grew in popularity, McCabe became increasingly hostile to it. He was well aware of the plight of the tenant-farmer and appalled by the wholesale evictions but he also had sympathy for the landlords who themselves faced economic ruin. He regularly condemned agrarian outrages and in October 1881 issued a pastoral letter denouncing in fierce terms the Land League's 'no rent' manifesto. He tried to keep priests out of politics and ended up isolating his fellow prelates and alienated himself from the generality of Irish nationalist opinion. So great was his unpopularity that his return from Rome in 1882 with the 'red hat' almost went un-noticed.

(39) 4. MORAN, Francis Patrick
(1830-1911)
Birth. December 16, 1830, Leighlinbridge, county Carlow, diocese of Kildare, Ireland. Son of Patrick Moran, a prosperous merchant, and Alicia Mary Cullen. The family had five children. One of his sisters, Teresa, was a Dominican nun. Nephew of Cardinal Paul Cullen (1866), who was his mother's stepbrother. His mother died when he was fourteen months old and his father when he was eleven years old; and three of his siblings died young. The Cullen family of Craan, Carlow, took care of him until 1842, when he was placed under the care of his mother's half-brother, Paul, who was rector of the Irish College, Rome, who became the formative influence of Francis Patrick.
Education. In Rome, he studied humanities, philosophy and theology at Seminario Romano, residing at the Irish College; later, he attended the Urbanian Athenaeum of Propaganda Fide, Rome, where he earned a doctorate in theology in 1852; Gioacchino Pecci, archbishop-bishop of Perugia, future Pope Leo XIII, was one of his examiners. Besides English, he spoke Italian, Latin, French, German, Spanish and Irish, as well as Hebrew and biblical Greek.
Priesthood. Ordained, March 19, 1853, Rome. He was appointed vice-rector of the Irish College in 1856; and also taught Hebrew Scripture at the Athenaeum of Propaganda Fide. It was at this time that he began his historical research, due to his training in paleography, his interest in archeology, and the fact that he had privileged access to the Vatican archives. Named domestic prelate of His Holiness. He returned to Ireland in 1866 as secretary of Cardinal Cullen, 1866-1872; and professor of Hebrew and Holy Scriptures at Clonliffe College (the diocesan seminary). He also taught Holy Scriptures, Irish history and biblical languages at the Catholic University of Ireland. Founder of the Irish Ecclesiastical Record in 1864. Monsignor Moran accompanied Cardinal Cullen to the First Vatican Council, 1869-1870.
Episcopate. Elected titular bishop of Olba and appointed coadjutor with right of succession of Ossory, December 22, 1871. Consecrated, March 5, 1872, at the pro-cathedral of Saint Mary, Dublin, by Cardinal Paul Cullen, archbishop of Dublin, assisted by James Walsh, bishop of Kildare and Leighlin, and by Thomas Furlong, bishop of Ferns. His episcopal motto was Omnia omnes. Succeeded to the see of Ossory, August 11, 1872. He dedicated himself to visit his diocese and to raise the intellectual level of the clergy. Promoted to the metropolitan see of Sydney, Australia, March 14, 1884 (according to a decree of the S.C. of Propaganda Fide of March 13, and this at the request of Australian bishops, eager to accentuate the "irlandisation" of the episcopate). This appointment matched his preference for the missions. He arrived in Australia the following September. He traveled thousands of miles visiting the churches and dioceses of his metropolitan province. Besides, he made five journeys to Rome on Church matters in 1885, 1888, 1893, 1902 and 1903. On May 1, 1885, he was summoned to Rome. He believed he would be offered the see of Dublin, but determined to urge Pope Leo XIII to allow him to return to Sydney. On arrival, he was informed that he was to be promoted to the cardinalate.
Cardinalate. Created cardinal priest in the consistory of July 27, 1885; received red hat and title of S. Susanna, July 30, 1885. He was the first Australian cardinal. He was named apostolic delegate to preside over the Plenary Council of Australasia, celebrated in November 1885, to reorganize the structure and the discipline of the Church; apostolic delegate to the Second and to the Third Plenary Councils celebrated in 1895 and in 1905. In 1895, he founded The Australasian Catholic Record and the Catholic Press. Did not participate in the conclave of 1903, because he arrived in Rome after the new Pope Pius X had been elected. He was a builder of churches, schools, orphanages and hospitals and an excellent administrator. He was also a prolific writer and a famous historian in the field of Irish ecclesiastical history he helped to revive (1). He wanted to leave the unilateral mold of Protestant historiography and use it as an element of Irish culture. Open to the modern world, he favored women's suffrage, education for girls and non-denominational unions; he was a great defender of the rights of Catholics, particularly concerning education; he sought assistance from the State only for non-religious activities and under government supervision; however, he led fight too timidly and it did not have great results. He fought for the revival of the language; and favored Home Rule (he considered the British occupation a legal injustice) while opposing extreme nationalism. He championed the political and syndical integration of the Irish in the Australian society while practicing a cultural and social segregation ("protection by segregation"); he forbade intermarriage and required the Catholics to attend religious schools. He strongly opposed the attacks from the Protestants, especially the Orangists; but unfortunately did not answer the overtures of the Anglicans. He also wanted to make the Australian Church the springboard for the evangelization of Asia. He was also an ardent promoter of social justice. He defended the Chinese immigrants against racist attacks and supported the moderate and not doctrinaire elements (excluding atheism and anarchism) of the Labor Party, which best represented the Catholics and most workers. He wanted the evolution to Christian democracy as the party of reform, which he felt was less intolerant toward Catholicism than the traditional parties, dominated by Protestants. He supported the federation of the six colonies that were to become the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901; and promoted the independence of its foreign policy and defense, which was intended to be nationalist while not denying the benefits of empire, and showed himself favorable to the Labor Party, especially in the issue of nationalization of industrial monopolies. He founded two seminars to train a native clergy.
Death. On August 16, 1911 (2), in Manly, Sydney; he was found dead on the floor of his bedroom and the cause was listed as a heart attack. Buried in Saint Mary's metropolitan cathedral, Sydney, after the funeral celebrated on August 20.

(1) The "exclusive" (veto) had not been exercised since the conclave of 1830-1831 and the Holy See had never formally recognized the practice. The Sacred College unanimously protested against the interference of a civil power into the election of the Supreme Pontiff. In the conclave of 1846, a veto against Cardinal Giovanni Maria Mastai Ferretti, archbishop-bishop of Imola, was going to be presented but failed because Cardinal Karl Kajetan Gaisruck, archbishop of Milan, Austria-Hungary, who was to present it, did not arrive in time. The new Pope Pius X would effectively end the use of the veto.

(57) 2. D'ANNIBALE, Giuseppe
(1815-1892)
Birth. September 22, 1815, Borbona, diocese of Rieti. From a modest family. Son of Giuseppe D'Annibale. Uncle of Cardinal Federico Tedeschini (1933) on his only sister's side, who married Luigi Tedeschini, from Antrodoco. Received the sacrament of confirmation, September 15, 1822.
Education. Received his initial formation from the parish priest. Received the clerical habit on November 8, 1828, and the insignias of the clerical character and the minor orders on July 29, 1832, from Gabriele Ferretti, bishop of Rieti, future cardinal. Because of economic difficulties, he was not able to enter the seminary until 1835, studying philosophy and theology. Ordained to the subdiaconate on September 22, 1838, and to the diaconate on March 30, 1839. Later obtained a doctorate in utroque iuris, both civil and canon law, in Rome.
Priesthood. Ordained, September 21, 1839, by Filippo de Conti Curoli, bishop of Rieti. After his ordination, he was sent back to Borbona for reasons unknown. Shortly after, he was named professor of dogmatic theology at the seminary, occupying the post for a year. He returned to his family in Borobona without a specific charge and remained there for ten years, from 1840 to 1850. During that period, he studied civil and Roman law. Named professor of moral theology in the Seminary of Rieti in 1851 by Father Paolo De Sanctis, rector of the seminary and his future biographer. In 1852, Bishop Gaetano Carletti of Rieti induced him to go to Rome and present himself as a doctoral candidate in utroque iure, both canon and civil law, at Collegio dei Protonotari Apostolici, which he obtained with great distinction. Shortly after, the bishop named him his vicar general; and later, canon of the cathedral chapter in February 1856; at the death of Bishop Carletti on July 26, 1867, he became vicar capitular until December 22, 1871, when Egidio Mauri, O.P., future cardinal, was preconized bishop of Rieti. He expanded and reworked the church of S. Maria Nuova, giving it the appearance that it has today. Encouraged by Bishop Mauri, he published in 1873 In Costitutionem Apostolicae Sedis, qua censurae latae sententiae limitantur Commentarii editi iussu illmi et remi Fr. Aegidii Mauri episcopi Reatini ad usum sacerdotum suae dioecesis. In 1874, he published the first volume of Summula theologiae moralis ad usum seminarii Reatini auctore I. D'Annibale cathedralis basilicae Reatinae canonico; in 1875, he published the second; and the following year, the third. The work was highly praised and appreciated by Gioacchino Pecci, archbishop-bishop of Perugia, future Pope Leo XIII. He also published the treatises De iustitia et iure; De legibus; De censuris; and De restitutione in genere. In spite of his reticence, he was promoted to the episcopate. On August 1, 1881, while he was in Ortona with Monsignor De Sanctis, he received the news of his promotion; he telegraphed his thanks and resignation; the response was that he had to accept.
Episcopate. Elected titular bishop of Caristo, August 12, 1881. Consecrated, August 14, 1881, church of SS. Trinità al Monte Pincio, Rome, by Cardinal Raffaele Monaco La Valletta, vicar general of Rome, assisted by Giulio Lenti, titular archbishop of Side, vice-gerent of Rome, and by Francesco Marinelli, O.S.A., titular bishop of Porfireone, sacristan of His Holiness. In the same ceremony was consecrated Sebastiano Galeati, bishop of Macerata et Tolentino, future cardinal. After the consecration, he returned to Rieti to his posts of vicar general and professor of theology at the seminary. On November 8, 1882, he had to move definitively to Rome to assume the post of canonist of the Apostolic Penitentiary. On April 25, 1883, he was named consultor of the Supreme S.C. of the Inquisition (Holy Office); and its assessor on November 14, 1884. Canon of the chapter of the patriarchal Vatican basilica, January 13, 1885.
Cardinalate. Created cardinal priest in the consistory of February 11, 1889; received the red hat and the title of Ss. Bonifacio ed Alessio, May 27, 1889. Named prefect of the S.C. of Indulgences and Relics on June 22, 1890. During the winter of 1891-1892 his bad health became worse. On July 16, 1892, he received the last sacraments.
Death. July 17 (1), 1892, Borbona, after receiving the extreme unction. Exposed in the parish church of Borbona, where the solemn funeral took place; and buried in a simple tomb in the cemetery of Borbona. On August 22, 1892, in the cathedral of Rieti, Canon Luigi Flavoni delivered the eulogy, which later was printed. On November 24, 1935, his remains were solemnly translated to the church of S. Maria Nuova, now S. Maria Assunta, Borbona. They were placed in an artistic urn (2).

On July 22, 1860 he founded the Academia Literaria de San Agustín, where a large number of the future ecclesiastical writers, orators, and polemicists as well as Chilean parliamentarians were formed. Professor of the Faculty of Theology of the University of Chile, August 1859. Traveled to Europe for a year, 1865-1866; he had an audience with Pope Pius IX. Traveled to Perú as member of the commission in charge of repatriating the remains of General Bernardo O'Higgins, which arrived in Valparaíso on January 13, 1869. Pastor of the parish of Santísimo Salvador in Valparaíso and vicar foráneo, June 22, 1868. Founded the Seminary of Valparaíso, June 2, 1869. Ecclesiastical governor of Valparaíso, November 2, 1872. When Archbishop Rafael Valentín Valdivieso of Santiago died on June 8, 1878, there was a conflict over the appointment of his successor; it lasted until Pope Leo XIII accepted the nomination of Msgr. Casanova made by President José Manuel Balmaceda, who had been his student at Academia San Agustín.
Episcopate. Elected archbishop of Santiago, December 3, 1886. Consecrated, January 30, 1887, cathedral of Santiago, by Joaquín Larraín Gandarillas, titular bishop of Martiropoli, auxiliary and vicar capitular of Santiago, assisted by Monsignor Jorge Montes, archdeacon, and by Monsignor Miguel Prado, canon of the metropolitan cathedral chapter. One of his first decisions was to send two young seminarians, Gilberto Fuenzalida Guzmán and José María Caro Rodríguez, future first cardinal of Chile, to study at Colegio Pío Latino Americano of Rome. Established the Catholic University of Santiago on June 21, 1888. Also, he founded the Instituto de Humanidades and the Escuela Normal de Preceptores; and ordered the establishment of parochial schools. In a letter dated October 25, 1888, he suggested to Pope Leo XIII the convenience of calling a continental council of all the peoples of Latin America; the letter marked the beginning of the process that culminated with the celebration of the Plenary Council of Latin America in Rome in 1899; dean of the archbishops who attended the council; he presided the first solemn session on May 28, 1899 and the first general congregation on May 29; towards the end of that congregation, he had to leave because of illness, leaving the presidency to Bernardo Herrera Restrepo, archbishop of Bogotá. During the civil war of 1890, he tried to mediate between the parties and avoid bloodshed; he opposed the participation of the clergy in favor of any of the two sides. He visited the ninety parishes of the archdiocese and established thirty two new ones; he restored the cathedral of Santiago, adding to it the chapel of the Most Holy Sacrament; brought to Chile several religious orders such as the Salesians, the Piarists, the Discalced Carmelites, and the Little Sisters of the Poor. Celebrated in 1895 the synod that set up the pastoral guidelines for the archdiocese. In 1898, he conducted the second pastoral visitation to the archdiocese. In 1904, he organized the First National Eucharistic Congress, which was celebrated the following year.
Cardinalate. Pope Leo XIII planned to promote Archbishop Casanova to the cardinalate, but several newspapers and members of the Church of Perú objected, alleging that the primate of South America was the archbishop of Lima and he was the one who should be named cardinal; the Holy See abandoned the idea to avoid a conflict between Perú and Chile (1); they also objected to the celebration of the council in Santiago and, eventually, it was held in Rome. In his last years, he suffered a nervous breakdown that weakened him enormously, eventually confining him to bed for the last month of his life.
Death. May 16, 1908, in Santiago. Buried in the crypt of the archbishopric in the metropolitan cathedral of Santiago (2).

(1) This is according to his biography in Biblioteca Comunale di Trento, linked below. Annuaire Pontifical Catholique 1911, p. 764, says that he was ordained on June 1, 1855.
(2) The emperor exercised, through the embassy, the rights of protection (at times participating in the administration) over several Roman institutions, among them, the Teutonic church of S. Maria dell'Anima; the Teutonic Campo Santo; the Confraternity of Santo Nome di Maria al Foro Traiano; the foundation of Loreto, the Collegios Germanico-Ungherese, Boemo, Ruteno and Polacco; the collegial chapter of S. Girolamo degli Schiavoni e degli Illirici; and The Austrian Historical Institute.
(3) Annuaire Pontifical Catholique 1911, p. 764, says that the post of dean of the Sacred Roman Rota was a cardinalitial one but that Monsignor Montel was never elevated to that rank; the sources then says that the reason is difficult to ascertain: some say that it was because of humility because the prelate contented himself with a secondary role from which he could accomplish the services with which he had been charged; and that others say that it was because of his hostility against Cardinal Mariano Rampolla del Tindaro, secretary of state of Pope Leo XIII, who had views contrary to those of Austria, and that Monsignor Montel had an active role in the veto against the election of Cardinal Rampolla presented by Cardinal Jan Puzyna in the name of the Austrian emperor in the conclave of 1903. Annuaire ends saying that, probably, the real reason will never be known. Menestrina, "Due prelati trentini ne giudizio de un vesco austriaco." Studi trentine di scienza storiche, p. 305, says Monsignor Montel was offered several times the cardinalate, and always rejected it for reasons not clarified by the official sources. But that the reason was not made any secret when with family and friends, who visited him in Povo, the conversation touched on the events of his long career. He had always loved - he said - freedom of movement and relationships with different people, no solemnity and haughtiness as a prince of the Church; he had no patience of the burdensome joke of a "candeliere" - (his word) - every time he went out of his home; in short, he just wanted to be a monsignor and nothing more. Weber, Quellen und Studien, p. 53-54, note 110, says that Emperor Franz Joseph I, asked Pope Leo XIII to promote Monsignor Montel to the cardinalate in 1894, but that the pope refused, probably because of the opposition of Cardinal Secretary of State Rampolla; then, on January 15, 1896 Otto von Bülow, the imperial chancellor, informed that the pope had offered Monsignor Montel, in agreement with the Austrian government request, the red hat, but that the prelate had rejected it. Weber says that according to the report of Chancellor von B|low, Monsignor Montel declined the promotion for personal reasons because he did not want to give up his freedom and be subjected to many of the annoying restrictions imposed on that rank, such as not being able to walk on foot in the streets or in an open carriage; he could only have four to six week vacations instead of living in the summer for three months in his beautiful Tusculum near Trent. Second, there were financial motives because as a cardinal he was would be worse off since he would be paid by the Curia and not by Austria. The main reason, included by Chancellor von B|low in his report, consisted in the fact that, as a cardinal, he would no longer be able to work for Austria as he had been doing until then. Weber adds that a similar version was offered by Graf von Hutten-Czapski, who wrote that the pope wanted him to make a cardinal, but that Monsignor Montel refused the purple because he wanted his freedom to move around in Rome instead of being forced to live in a pompous seclusion. Moreover, Weber says that, based on an article from Le Patriote of Brussels, dated March 1, 1898, German ambassador Baron H. Von Alvensleben informed Berlin that Monsignor Montel had again declined the cardinalate offered to him by the pope.

CORMIER, O.P., Hyacinthe-Marie
(1832-1916)
Birth. December 8, 1832, Orlèans, France. Of a family of well to do merchants. His baptismal name was Henry. His father died while he was still a child, and his mother took him and his only brother, Eugène, to live near his uncle, who was a priest. His brother died shortly afterwards.
Education. Received his initial education at home; he then studied in the school of the Christian Brothers until he entered the Minor Seminary of Orlèans, where he completed his secondary education; and then, he entered the Major Seminary of Orlèans, conducted by the Sulpitian Fathers, where he studied philosophy and theology; he was admitted into the Third Order of Saint-Dominick while he was a seminarian.
Priesthood. Ordained on May 17, 1856 by Bishop Felix-Antoine-Philibert Dupanloup of Orlèans; he was granted a dispensation to be ordained without having reached the canonical age. After ordination, he resolved without delay to enter the religious state. Accordingly, he went to Lavigny, where Father Henri Lacordaire, O.P., had opened a novitiate for the Order of Preachers (Dominicans). Father Cormier was accepted into the order, after having received permission from his bishop not without regret; and given the name Hyacinthe. He entered the novitiate of Flavigny, Côted'Or and received the habit on June 29, 1856. During the novitiate his health deteriorated in such a way that it seemed that he was not going to be able to continue with the austerity of the order. The fathers of the novitiate decided to send him home. Then the master general of the order, Father Alexandre Vincent Jandel, O.P., who was making his canonical visit to the convent of Flavigny, decided to take Father Cormier to Rome and sent him to the convent of S. Sabina on the Aventine, where an international novitiate had recently been established. When his health did not improve, Father Jandel recurred to Pope Pius IX for an extension of his novitiate. The pope granted the request and Father Cormier was allowed to make his profession on May 23, 1859, in the chapter room of the Dominican convent of S. Sabina. At this point he recovered and became the private secretary of the master general. He then became master of novices in the convent of S. Sabina and after two years, he was elected prior of the convent of Corbora in Corsica. During the years 1866 to 1874 and 1878 to 1882, he was the first provincial of the restored province of Toulouse (1865), serving intermittently as prior in various convents. In 1888, he was entrusted with the foundation of a new convent and the construction of the a church in Biarritz. In 1890, the convent of Saint-Maximin, the principal house of the province, elected him prior. From 1891 to 1896, he was socius, with the title of provincial of the Holy Land, to master general Andreas Frühwirth, future cardinal. From May 27, 1896 until 1904, he was procurator general of the order. On July 24, 1896, he was nominated consultor of the S.C. of the Holy Office.
Cardinalate. According to Sadoc Szabo in Hyacinth Marie Cormier: 76th Master General of the Order of Preachers (Summit, New Jersey : Dominican nuns, 1938), p. 17, in 1899, Pope Leo XIII wanted to create Father Cormier cardinal but he was prevented because "the French government did not look favorably upon a cardinal chosen from a religious order to seek its interest as a member of the Roman Curia." The first two biographies, linked below, also mention his intended promotion to the cardinalate. On May 21, 1904, he was elected master general of the Order of Preachers at the chapter celebrated in the convent of S. Maria de la Quercia, near Viterbo. His motto was Caritas Veritatis. As master general, restored many suppressed provinces and erected new ones, including that of the Holy Name in western United States of America. In 1909, he founded in Rome the Pontifical University of S. Tommaso d'Aquino, commonly known as the Angelicum. On May 17, 1916, he celebrated the sixtieth anniversary of his priestly ordination. He finished his term of office on Pentecost 1916. On August 3, 1916, his successor as master general, Father Louis Theissling, provincial of Holland, was elected. He wrote several works mainly on spiritual formation and exercises (1). A noted spiritual director, he was an esteemed confidant of Pope Pius X.
Death. December 17, 1916, at 12.30 pm., after a brief illness, in his cell in the convent of S. Clemente, in Rome; at the time of his death, Cardinal Tommaso Pio Boggiani, O.P., was celebrating a pontifical mass in honor of the seven hundredth anniversary of the founding of the Order of Preachers. His body was laid in state at the sacristy of the church of S. Clemente. The solemn obsequies were celebrated at the church of S. Maria sopra Minerva on December 20. The mass was sung by Father Serafino Cimino, minister general of the Order of the Friars Minor (Franciscans) in the presence of numerous cardinals, bishops, prelates, superiors general of religious orders and congregations. The pope sent a letter of condolence to Father Theissling through the cardinal secretary of State. After the funeral, the body was taken to Campo Verano cemetery, Rome, and buried in the tomb of the Order of Preachers. On January 18, 1917, the thirtieth-day mass was celebrated at the church of S. Antonio. In December 1934, his remains were buried in the church of Ss. Domenico e Sisto, Rome, annexed to the Angelicum.
Beatification. His cause for beatification was introduced in 1945. He was beatified on November 20, 1994, by Pope John Paul II. His feast is celebrated on May 21, date of his election as master general of the Order of Preachers.
