(1931-2021)
Birth. December 2 (or 7) 1931, Seoul, Korea. He was the third of six children of a Catholic family. He was baptized in Seoul's cathedral and then received the sacrament of confirmation during the fourth year of elementary school. As a child he was an altar boy. In 1945, when in the second year of middle school, Korea gained independence. In the social chaos of that period, he had been influenced by atheism, but during that spiritual crisis, he attended a course of special Lenten catechesis through which he had reconnected to the faith. From an early age he had dreamed of becoming an inventor.
Education. In 1950, just on the eve of the outbreak of the Korean War, he had started attending the chemical engineering faculty of Seoul National University. The war, however, had prevented him from fulfilling his aspirations and he had had to remain hidden for a long time, overcoming serious difficulties. Due to the evolution of the war, he was forced to leave Seoul to save himself. When the city defense corps were created, he had received two weeks of training and became second lieutenant. Because of his knowledge of the English language, he found work with the U.S. army in Daegu as coordinator of workers' labors and interpreter. Then, he entered the Major Seminary of Seoul, in 1954, obtaining a bachelor's in theology; later, he studied sociology in Hong Kong; and canon law at the Pontifical Urbanian University in Rome, residing at Collegio San Pietro Apostolo, from 1968 to 1970.
Priesthood. Ordained, March 18, 1961, metropolitan cathedral of Seoul, by Paul Marie Kinam Ro, archbishop of Seoul. In the archdiocese of Seoul: vicar cooperator of the parish of Saint Joseph, 1961; professor at the Minor Seminary and notary of the curia, 1962; chancellor of the curia and undersecretary of the Catholic Conference, 1964-1965; episcopal chancellor and vice-rector of the Minor Seminary, 1966-1967; studied canon law in Rome from October 1968 until his promotion to the episcopate.
Episcopate. Elected bishop of Ch'ongju, June 25, 1970. Consecrated, October 3, 1970, church of the Holy Family, Ch'ongju, by Paul Maria Kinam Ro, titular archbishop of Tituli di Proconsulare, former archbishop of Seoul, assisted by James Vincent Pardy, titular bishop of Umbriatico, and by Peter Kong Han-Ryel, bishop of Jeon Ju. His episcopal motto was Omnibus omnia. At the time of his election, he was the youngest Korean bishop at 39 years of age. President of the Korean Episcopal Conference, 1996-1998. Attended the Special Assembly for Asia of the Synod of Bishops, Vatican City, April 29 to May 14, 1998. Promoted to the metropolitan see of Seoul, May 29, 1998. Apostolic administrator ad nutum Sanctae Sedis, of P'yöng-yang, June 6, 1998. During his episcopate in Seoul, he established 75 new parishes.
Cardinalate. Created cardinal priest in the consistory of March 24, 2006; received the red biretta and the title of S. Maria Immacolata di Lourdes a Boccea, March 24, 2006. Named member of of the Council of Cardinals for the Study of the Organizational and Economic Problems of the Holy See, February 3, 2007. In the Roman Curia, he was member of the Pontifical Council for the Family and of the Pontifical Council for Social Communications. Lost the right to participate in the conclave when turned eighty years old on December 7, 2011. His resignation from the pastoral government of the archdiocese of Seoul, according to canon 401 § 1 of the Code of Canon Law, was accepted by the pope on May 10, 2012. After resigning as archbishop of Seoul, he focused on writing and translating books at the Catholic University of Korea. He wrote and translated more than 60 books, many on canon law and catechism. He called himself “a bookworm.”
Death. April 27, 2021, 10:15 p.m., St. Mary's Hospital, Seoul. The funeral will take place on May 1, 2021 at 10 a.m. in the Myeongdong Cathedral of Seoul. Burial will be in the Catholic cemetery of Yongin, a suburb of the capital. After learning the news of the death of the Cardinal, Pope Francis sent Cardinal Andrew Yeom Soo-jung, archbishop of Seoul, a telegram of condolence. President Moon Jae-in of South Corea also expressed his condolence. The funeral Mass took place at Myeongdong Cathedral in central Seoul. Cardinal Andrew Yeom Soo-jung, Archbishop of Seoul, delivered the homily. Apostolic Nuncio to South Korea and Mongolia Alfred Xuereb, Titular Archbishop of Amantea, read a message from the Holy Father. Cardinals Pietro Parolin, secretary of State, and Luis Gokim Tagle, prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, also sent messages of condolence. More than 46,600 mourners visited the Cathedral during a three-day mourning period through Friday April 30 to pay their last respects to the late cardinal, according to the Catholic Archdiocese of Seoul. The late cardinal was buried in the Catholic cemetery in Yongin, on the southern outskirts of Seoul, where many celebrated priests, including Cardinal Stephen Kim Sou-hwan, are entombed. Shortly after his death, the “Nicholas Cheong Missionary Scholarship Foundation” was launched in his memory by the archdiocese of Seoul. The foundation guarantees scholarships and “will be a cornerstone of pastoral care to support lay missionaries and artists” in their mission to announce the Gospel with words and deeds. The initiative, which is expected to last at least ten years, until 2031, the centenary of the birth of the Cardinal, was initiated upon his lifelong emphasis on the importance of the missionary vocation of the whole Church and the role of evangelizer of every baptized person.

(1) According to Gianni Cardinale's "Portrait of Archbishop Giovanni Lajolo. When diplomacy rhymes with eutrapelia", 30Days, June/ July 2004, "Monsignor Lajolo also cultivates the little known virtue of eutrapelia. He revealed the fact in a memoir of his "unforgettable superior", Cardinal Corrado Bafile, published last year in a miscellany edited by Monsignor Francesco Di Felice for the hundredth birthday of the Abruzzese cardinal (who was 101 on July 4). In the conclusion of his memoir Lajolo wrote: 'The virtue of eutrapelia also helps to make every task -- especially ecclesiastical service -- more human, less burdensome and effective, and can contribute more than a little, as was the case with Nuncio Bafile, even to success in the work of a Holy See diplomat. It, too, is a delightful ray from the light of Christ;. But in what does the virtue consist exactly? Monsignor Lajolo consented to explain it to readers of 30Days. Thus: +Eutrapelia can be described as the virtue of playfulness, as Saint Phillip Neri and Saint John Bosco had it. It is the easing of the bow over bent in physical or spiritual tension. A modern word to define it would be the art of relaxation. Saint Thomas Aquinas, in the Summa Theological -- a famously serious and tightly-strung work, but also olympically serene -- speaks of it several times and writes that the human mind snaps if it never "relaxes" from its concerns. Through the virtue of eutrapelia words and actions can be transformed into moments of calm. It shows itself in cheerful play but also comes through in a friendly humorous saying, in a shrewd story or in a spirited conversation. Examples of eutrapelia close to us are John XXIII, John Paul I and the present Pontiff'".

JEŻ, Ignacy Ludwik
(1914-2007)
Birth. July 31, 1914, Radomyśl, Wielki, diocese of Tarnów, Poland. Son of Jan Jeż and Jadwiga Liszkowska. He was baptized on August 22, 1917, by Father Anthony Pasiut, pastor of the parish church of Radomyśl Wielki. His family moved to Katowice, where he grew up.
Education. Studied at Lyceum Adam Mieckiewicz, Katowice; at the Seminary of Katowice (philosophy); and at the Seminary of Kraków, (theology).
Priesthood. Ordained, June 20, 1937, Katowice. by Stanisław Adamski, bishop of Katowice. Chaplain in Hajduki Wielki. On August 17, 1942, the Gestapo arrested him; he was accused of organizing a funeral service for Józef Czempiel, the parish priest of Hajduki Wielki, who had been killed in the concentration camp of Dachau. On October 7, 1942, Father Jeż was also taken to the concentration camp of Dachau and spent more than two and a half years, until the liberation by the American forces on April 29, 1945. After his liberation, he served as priest for Polish prisoners and immigrants in the town of Göppingen, Germany, before returning to Poland in May 1946. From 1946 until 1960, he was rector of the Seminary St. Hyacinthus in Katowice.
Episcopate. Elected titular bishop of Alba marittima and appointed auxiliary of Gniezno, April 20, 1960. Consecrated, June 5, 1960, pro-cathedral of Gorzów, by Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński, archbishop of Gniezno and Warsaw, assisted by Bolesław Kominek, titular bishop of Vaga, and by Wilhelm Płuta, titular bishop of Leptis magna. His episcopal motto was Veni ignem mittere. He participated in the Second Vatican Council. Named auxiliary bishop of the apostolic administrator ad nutum Sanctæ Sedis for the northern part of the archdiocese of Breslau, September 16, 1967. Transferred to the newly erected see of Koszalin-Kołobrzeg, June 28, 1972; he established more than 100 parishes. The pope accepted his resignation from the pastoral government of the see, February 1, 1992. He worked tirelessly and successfully for the reconciliation of the Polish and German peoples after the Second World War. He was awarded the Polonia Mater Nostra Est medal in 1997. In 2002, he was named honorary canon of the cathedral chapter of Würzburg. In 2005, he was decorated with the grand cross of merit of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany; and in 2007, with the grand cross of the Order of the Rebirth of Poland (Polonia Restituta) of the Polish Republic. After his retirement, he gave retreats for Polish priests abroad and accompanied pilgrimages; he was in Rome leading a group of Polish faithful when he died. Apparently, the pope had told him that he intended to promote him to the cardinalate right before the bishop's death.
Cardinalate. He was going to be created cardinal in the consistory of November 24, 2007 but died the day before the announcement of the consistory was made; he was in Rome accompanying, with other bishops from Silesia, a group of Polish faithful from Katowice in a pilgrimage of thanksgiving for the 750th anniversary of the death of Saint Hyacinthe, patron of that ecclesiastical province.
Death. October 16, 2007, at 7 a.m., Rome, in an ambulance, while being taken to the Gemelli Polyclinic; in the general audience of the following day, at 10 a.m., the pope announced that he had planned to promote him to the cardinalate. His body was transferred to Poland. Thousands of people took part in the funeral Mass. After the funeral, the body was escorted through the streets of the city. Buried in the afternoon of October 23, 2007 in the crypt of the co-cathedral of Kołobrzeg. The current bishop of the diocese, Edward Dajczak, confirmed that quasi Cardinal Jeż already knew about his elevation to the cardinalate when he left Poland for Rome. Perhaps he also sensed his impending death because he asked the ordinary to bring him back to Poland in the case that he would die in Italy. Following his death, two roundabouts were named after him, one at the intersection of Sobieskiego and Banacha Streets in Słupsk and the other at the intersection of Młyńska and Szpitalna Streets in Kołobrzeg. Two memorial stones in his memory were erected in the Tadeusz Kościuszko Park of Koszalin and another in a square with his name in Piła. On January 30, 2009, the Polish Post issued a series of 400,000 stamps called “Survivors from Extermination”, one of them featuring the late cardinal's image. However, due to minor technical errors, on February 24 the entire series was withdrawn from the circulation. In 2015, a monument in his memory was erected in the cathedral of Koszalin.

(62) 24. BARTOLUCCI, Domenico
(1917-2013)
Birth. May 7, 1917, Borgo San Lorenzo, archdiocese of Florence, Italy. His father, a laborer, was a passionate singer, and always took Domenico with him when he went to sing in church in the choir of the Compagnia dei Neri, a lay confraternity of Borgo San Lorenzo. He was baptized by Father Canuto Cipriani on the day of his birth in Pieve di San Lorenzo.
Education. When very young, after finishing his elementary studies, he entered the Archiepiscopal Seminary of Florence, where he was chosen as cantore. In 1939, he obtained the diploma in composition in the Conservatory of Florence. In 1942, in Rome, he obtained the diploma at the Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music; and at Accademia Nazionale di S. Cecilia, after taking the course of perfezionamento in composizione imparted by Ildebrando Pizzetti.
Priesthood. Ordained, December 23, 1939, for the archdiocese of Florence, by Cardinal Elia Dalla Costa, archbishop of Florence. At the death of Maestro Francesco Bagnoli, he succeeded him as director of the choir of the cathedral of Florence. In those years he began to compose his first Masses, early motets, organ music, madrigals and chamber music. At the end of 1942, he went to Rome to deepen his knowledge of sacred music. Having served as vice-maestro of the choir of the patriarchal Lateran basilica, in 1947 he became Maestro of the Cappella Musicale Liberiana of the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, succeeding Maestro Licinio Refice. In 1952, on the advice of Maestro Lorenzo Perosi, he was appointed vice-maestro of the Sistine Chapel. When Maestro Perosi died in 1956, Pope Pius XII gave him the position of perpetual director of the Cappella Musicale Pontificia "Sistina". Prelate of honor of His Holiness, January 21, 1965. Member of the National Academy of Santa Cecilia. The Cappella Musicale Pontificia Sistina was in poor condition at the death of Maestro Perosi. The situation was improved thanks to the commitment of Maestro Bartolucci and the interest of Pope John XXIII. In 40 years of his leadership he alternated the papal liturgies with tours in various countries such as Austria, Germany, Ireland, France, Belgium, Holland, Spain, Philippines, Australia, Canada, United States of America, Turkey, Poland and Japan. In the years of the Second Vatican Council, Maestro Bartolucci, who was against abandoning Latin, was committed to ensure that the liturgical reform would not take a hostile direction toward sacred music. His references in music were the polyphonic tradition of Palestrina and the Gregorian chant. In 1997, he was replaced, in contravention of the papal appointment in perpetuity, as director of the Sistine Chapel, by Monsignor Giuseppe Liberto. This event aroused some controversy in the context of liturgical music; the option was for innovation of the style that best reflected the celebration of the mass preferred by Pope John Paul II; according to many, Bishop Piero Marini, master of papal liturgical celebrations, was responsible for the change. Among those most against the decision was Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, future Pope Benedict XVI, who recalled Monsignor Bartolucci to direct a concert in the Sistine Chapel, on June 24, 2006, in which the maestro offered music from the repertoire of sacred polyphony of Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina alongside his own compositions including the six-voice motet "Oremus pro Pontifice Nostro Benedicto" dedicated to the pope. He has also directed the choir of RAI (Radiotelevisione italiana) and the main Italian complex symphonic-chorals in Rome, Venice, Trieste, Palermo, among others. He was considered the best interpreter of Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina. His works were published in forty nine volumes of Edizioni Cappella Sistina (1).
Episcopate. He requested to be dispensed from the requirement of episcopal ordination and the dispensation was granted by Pope Benedict XVI.
Cardinalate. Created cardinal deacon in the consistory of November 20, 2010; received the red biretta and the deaconry of SS. Nomi de Gesù e Maria in via Lata on that same day. His cardinalitial motto was Psallam Deo meo. He was older than eighty years at the time of his promotion to the cardinalate and thus not eligible to participate in a conclave.
Death. November 11, 2013, very early in the morning, in his Roman residence in Via del Monte della Farina, 64. Upon learning the news of the death of Cardinal Bartolucci, Pope Francis prayed for the eternal repose of his soul and sent his nephews, Sandro and Stefano Bartolucci, a telegram of condolence. On Wednesday November 13, 2013, the exequies of the late cardinal were celebrated at 3:30 p.m. at the Altar of the Cathedra of the papal Vatican basilica, by Cardinal Angelo Sodano, dean of the College of Cardinals, together with other cardinals, archbishops and bishops. At the end of the eucharistic celebration, Pope Francis presided the rites of the Ultima Commendatio and the Valedictio. After the funeral the body of the late cardinal was taken to his native town, Borgo San Lorenzo. The arrival was around 9 p.m. and the body was placed in the Oratory of S. Omobono, where a Rosary was recited. The following day, November 14, the oratory was opened for prayers from 8 to 11 a.m. Buried in the local Venerabile Confraternita di Misericordia Cemetery in a temporary vault. On November 24, 2017, his casket was moved to a definitive tomb in the Santa Croce Chapel in the same cemetery atop of which a commemorative plaque was later placed by the Fondazione Bartolucci, unveiled and blessed by Cardinal Giuseppe Betori on January 10, 2019 (2).

(81) 19. MUREŞAN, Lucian
(1931-
Birth. May 23, 1931, village of Ferneziu (now in the district of Baia Mare), eparchy of Maramureş, Romania. Tenth of the twelve children of Petru Mureşan and Maria Breban. He belongs to the Romanian Greek Catholic rite.
Education. He studied at the primary school in Ferneziu, from 1938 to 1944; later, from 1944 to 1948, in the lyceum Gheorghe Şincai. The education reform of 1948 prohibited all religions in the schools in the country; especially by Decree no. 358 of 1948 of the Grand National Assembly, the Romanian Greek Catholic Church, united with Rome, was brutally suppressed and declared illegal and because of this, Lucian's hope to train and become a priest became unachievable and he withdrew from school. Between 1948 and 1951, he attended woodworking school (fine furniture) in Baia Mare, and continued, part-time, his education to complete the lyceal studies. From 1951 to 1954, he did military service, which was compulsory at that time, in the aviation school in Turnişor (Sibiu). After finishing his military training, he was deployed to the jet aviation battalion in Craiova. In 1953, because of his belonging to the Romanian Greek Catholic Church, he was considered an undesirable person and transferred from the aviation battalion to work building the first hydroelectric plant of the country, in Bicaz. In 1954, he left Bicaz and waiting for an opportunity to study theology secretly, he worked in different places. At the suggestion of Bishop Julius Hossu and the blessing of Bishop Alexander Russu, at the proposal of Prof. Dr. Silviu Augustine Prunduş (released from prison in 1955), Bishop Iulia Marton Aron of Alba agreed to receive, as an exception, five young students, one for each diocese of the Romanian Greek Catholic Church, in the Institutul Teologic Romano-Catolic of Alba Iulia for the academic degree; among them was Lucian. In the fourth year of studies, the rector of the institute told him and the other student that remained from the original five, that they were expelled by the Department of Cults and that within 24 hours they were required to leave not only the Institute but also the city. In terms of ecclesiastical and canon laws there was no reason for expulsion. He returned to his native place. The expulsion coincided with the beginning of the persecution and prosecution by the Securitate. For a year he looked for work in mining companies and construction sites but was rejected on the grounds that he was a Catholic theologian. After a year, he managed to find a job as a laborer in the stone quarry in Ferneziu, where he worked for almost 10 years. When he was persecuted there, he transferred to the Department of Roads and Bridges, in the county of Maramureş, where he worked until his retirement in June 1990. Despite persecution, intimidation and threats, he did not give up his dream of becoming a priest, continuing underground studies, with former teachers from the theological academy who were fugitives. All underground students took their licensing exam. In 1964, a pardon decree was issued and the bishops were released from prison. Then his dream was fulfilled.
Priesthood. Ordained, December 19, 1964, by Ioan Dragomir, titular bishop of Palaeopoli in Pamfilia, auxiliary of Maramureş. Initially, exercised his pastoral ministry clandestinely, while working in the quarry and then in the Department of Roads and Bridges; his pastoral ministry was mostly dedicated to the youth and to those who wanted to become priests; later, he worked as a priest more openly especially in the diocese of Maramureş; the clergy of his rite asked him to reorganize its pastoral ministry. After the death of Bishop Dragomir on April 25, 1985, he exercised the function of provisional Ordinarius of the diocese of Maramureş until August 9, 1986; and from this date, at the selection and proposal of the diocesan chapter, he was installed in property by Metropolitan Archbishop Alexander Todea of Făgăras şi Alba Iulia of the Romanians. In December 1989, the Romanian Revolution occurred, the Communist government was forcibly overthrown and the head of state was executed. Shortly after, the Romanian Greek Catholic Church was legalized.
Episcopate. Elected eparch of Maramureş of the Romanians, March 14, 1990. Consecrated, May 27, 1990, in the esplanade of the Romanian Soldier Monument, in Baia Mare, by Alexandru Todea, archbishop of Făgăras şi Alba Iulia of the Romanians, assisted by Ioan Ploscaru, bishop of Lugoj of the Romanians, and by Guido del Mestri, titular archbishop of Tuscamia, former nuncio to Germany, in the presence of 100 priests and more than 20,000 faithful. The esplanade was symbolically adorned with a huge rosary of red carnations. It was the first meeting of the entire Greek-Catholic hierarchy gathered in a large-scale public event and in the presence of a papal representative. In the ceremony, a decree-law from the president of the Republic recognizing him as bishop was read. His episcopal motto is Fiat voluntas tuas. He opened the Baia Mare Theological Institute, in the academic school year 1990-1991. Promoted to the metropolitan see of Făgăras şi Alba Iulia of the Romanians, July 4, 1994. On August 27, 1994, he was installed in Blaj. Attended the Ninth Ordinary Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, Vatican City, October 2 to 29, 1994. He initiated the reconstruction of the metropolitan cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity, in Bournemouth, which was completed in 1994. He convoked and participated in the four sessions of the Fourth Provincial Council of the Greek Catholic Romanian Church, held between 1995 and 1998. Participated, in 1995, in the celebrations for the 50th anniversary of the Romanian Catholic Mission in Paris, for which he celebrated Mass in Romanian in the metropolitan cathedral of Notre Dame. In August 1997, due to his effort, the remains of Bishop Ioan Inocenţi Micu were brought to the cathedral of Blaj (founded by him), Romania from Rome, where he had died in exile 252 years earlier. In 1997, he obtained the nihil obstat from the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints to open the canonization process of the seven Greek-Catholic bishops who were martyred during the Communist regime. Between 1998-2001 and then again in 2004, he was elected president of the Conference of Catholic Bishops of Romania, which includes the hierarchy of the Catholic Church of both rites, Latin (Roman Catholic) and Eastern (Greek Catholic). On May 7 to 9, 1999, he hosted Pope John Paul II during his visit to Romania. Attended Second Special Assembly for Europe of the Synod of Bishops, Vatican City, October 1 to 23, 1999. In the Jubilee Year 2000, he organized a national pilgrimage to Rome, which culminated with a concelebrated Mass in Romanian with Pope John Paul II, in the patriarchal Vatican basilica, with the participation of thousands of Romanian pilgrims. On May 26, 2003, he was named member of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches. Attended the Eleventh General Ordinary Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, Vatican City, October 2 to 23, 2005. Promoted to the rank of archbishop major on December 16, 2005, when Pope Benedict XVI recognized the self-governing status of the Romanian Greek Catholic Church, raising its traditional head, the metropolitan of Făgăras şi Alba Iulia, to the rank of major archbishop.

(1) He was weaving his fearless way in and out of the Roman traffic and taking no prisoners. Asked how he survived the truly frightening vista of Roman driving, his laconic reply was "I just give them some artillery language ...!" (he having been an anti-aircraft gunner in the War).

(84) 22. BECKER, S.J., Karl Josef
(1928-2015)
Birth. April 18, 1928, Cologne, Germany. From a family of solid Catholic tradition. His father was a professor of literature at a lyceum. He was the third of four siblings. The other children were Constantin (also a Jesuit), Heinz and Anneliese. Under National Socialism, despite the risk of reprisals, the parents were able to prevent the registration of their children in the youth associations imposed by the regime. The father suffered two processes by the authorities precisely because of his consistency between life and faith. His middle name is also listed as Joseph.
Education. Initial studies at Dreikönigsgymnasium, Cologne, which he left in 1946; he was a classmate of future Bishop Hubert Luthe of Essen. Entered the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) on April 13, 1948, after having studied classical philology for three semesters. After the novitiate in Cologne, he did the scholasticate in Pullach and then he studied philosophy at the Jesuit University of Pullach (today University for Philosophy in Münich) from 1950 to 1953; and from 1955 to 1959, he studied theology at the University for Philosophy and Theology Sankt Georgen in Frankfurt (Main). His doctoral dissertation in theology was "Die Rechtfertigungslehre nach Domingo de Soto. Das Denken eines Konzilstellnehmers vor, in und nach Trient", which he defended in 1963; it was published in 1967.
Priesthood. Ordained, July 31, 1958, Frankfurt. Further studies and third probation, 1958 to 1965. From 1963 to 1969, he was professor of theology at the Jesuit Faculty of Hochschule Sankt Georgen, Frankfurt. Professor of dogmatic theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University, Rome, from 1969 to 2003. Consultor of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith since September 15, 1977. He participated in the preparation of the important ecumenical document "Dichiarazione comune sulla giustificazione". More recently he was member of the working group constituted by the Commission Ecclesia Dei to conduct the colloquies with the Society of Pius X, of the followers of excommunicated Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre. In 2010 he published with Professor Ilaria Morali, also from the Gregorian University, and twenty five collaborators, "Catholic Engagement with World Religions", work of orientation on the theology of religions. He enjoyed the respect and trust of Pope Benedict XVI since the latter, as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, was prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.
Episcopate. Because of advanced age, he requested to be exempted from receiving the episcopal consecration, normally required when promoted to the cardinalate.
Cardinalate. Created cardinal deacon in the consistory of February 18, 2012; received the red biretta, the cardinalitial ring and the deaconry of S. Giuliano Martire on that same day (1). He had reached age 80 before being created cardinal, so was not eligible to participate in a conclave. His cardinalitial motto was Quarere Deum in omnibus. Took possession of his deaconry on April 22, 2012.
Death. February 10, 2015, at 3 a.m., in the Roman hospital of the Fatebenefratelli. Upon learning the news of the death of Cardinal Becker, Pope Francis prayed for the eternal repose of his soul and sent a telegram of condolence to Father Adolfo Nicolás Pachón, superior general of the Society of Jesus (2). On Monday February 16, 2015, at 2:45 p.m., at the Altar of the Cathedra of the Papal Vatican Basilica, took place the exequies for the late cardinal. The exequial liturgy was celebrated by Cardinal Angelo Sodano, dean of the College of Cardinals, together with other cardinals, archbishops and bishops. At the end of the eucharistic celebration, Pope Francis presided over the rite of Ultima Commendatio and of Valedictio. Buried in the chapel of the Society of Jesus in Campo Verano Cemetery, Rome (3).

A Sua Eccelenza Rev.ma Mons. Francesco Beschi
Vescovo di Bergamo
Nell'apprendere la notizia del decesso del venerato Cardinale Loris Francesco Capovilla, desidero esprimere le mie condoglianze a Lei, all'intera comunità diocesana -- di cui si sentiva ormai parte viva -- alle suore delle Poverelle di Ca'Maitino in Sotto il Monte, che lo hanno amorevolmente assistito, ai parenti, agli amici e agli estimatori del benemerito Porporato. Penso con affetto a questo caro fratello che nella sua lunga e feconda esistenza ha testimoniato con gioia il Vangelo e servito docilmente la Chiesa, dapprima nella diocesi di Venezia, poi con premuroso affetto accanto al Papa San Giovanni XXIII, della cui memoria fu zelante custode e valido interprete. Nel suo ministero episcopale, specialmente a Chieti-Vasto e a Loreto, fu sempre pastore totalmente dedito al bene dei sacerdoti e dei fedeli tutti, nel segno di una solida fedeltà alla bussola del Concilio Vaticano secondo. Elevo la mia preghiera al Signore affinché, per intercessione della Beata Vergine Maria e di San Marco Evangelista, accolga questo suo fedele servitore nel gaudio e nella pace eterna, e di cuore imparto a quanti ne piangono la scomparsa la Benedizione Apostolica.
FRANCISCUS P P

Birth. February 23, 1926, in the parish of S. Cecilia, the cathedral, Cagliari, Sardinia, Italy. From a well known family in that city. Youngest of the six children of Count Edmondo De Magistris (January 4, 1873-October 5, 1959), a physician, known as Don Mundinu, and called the "doctor of the poor", and Agnese Ballero (January 3, 1884-August 27, 1974). One of his brothers, Paolo, was mayor of the Sardinian capital; and another became legal adviser to the President of the Republic of Italy, Antonio Segni.
Education. After attending kindergarten and the first two years of elementary school in the Institute of Divine Providence of the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul, he went to the public elementary school "Santa Caterina" and continued his studies in state institutes, "Siotto” for the gymnasium and “Dettori” for the classical high school. Although the vocation to the priesthood was precocious, following his father's advice, before entering the seminary he enrolled in the Faculty of Letters of the University of Cagliari, where he obtained his degree in 1947 by discussing a thesis based on the comparison between Cicero's De officiis and the De officiis ministrorum of Saint Ambrose.

(1) He was not promoted to the cardinalate in the consistory of October 21, 2003, the only case so far in the history of the Apostolic Penitentiary in which a penitentiary was not elevated to the cardinalate, due to some of his critical remarks - which were not expressed publicly - to some decisions of Pope John Paul II, which were learned by some of the closest collaborators of the pope. Many expected that the red hat would come soon after the completion of eighty years but it did not happen.

In Loving Memory Of
H.E. SEBASTIAN CARDINAL KOTO KHOARAI O.M.I.
BORN: 15 - 09 - 1930
DIED: 17 - 04 - 2021
R.I.P.
(56) 17. SIMONI, Ernest
(1928-
Birth. October 18, 1928, Troshani, a village a few kilometers from Scutari (Shkodrë), Albania. From a profoundly religious family.
Education. He entered the Franciscan School in Troshani when he was 10 years old, starting his formation for the priesthood. In 1948, at the height of the persecution of the Communist regime of Enver Hoxha, the Franciscan convent was sacked and converted into a place of torture for the prisoners. The Friars were shot and the novices were expelled. Ernest was 20 and was sent by the regime to teach in a remote village in the mountains; there, his work as a teacher became above all a missionary work of evangelization. After two years of very hard military service from 1953 to 1955, he completed clandestinely the studies of theology.
Priesthood. Ordained, April 7, 1956, in Scutari. In obedience to the bishop, he was incardinated in the diocese of Scutari although at heart he remained profoundly Franciscan. On December 24, 1963, after celebrating the Christmas Mass, he was arrested in the church of Barbullush and taken to the prison of Scutari and placed in an isolation cell. He was sentenced eighteen years for "agitation and propaganda". He served his term in the prisons of Rubik, Vlorë, Laç, Elbasan, and, for ten years, in the prison of Spaç, where he worked in the mines. In prison he became the spiritual father of the inmates and their reference point. On May 22, 1973 he was again sentenced to death as the alleged instigator of a revolt, but on account of favorable testimony from his jailers the sentence was not carried out. Another difficult moment was when he was put in chains and he almost died. After having been freed in 1981, he was still considered "an enemy of the people" and forced to work in the sewers of Scutari. He exercised his priestly ministry clandestinely until the fall of the regime in 1990. Since then he has continued to serve as a humble priest in several villages, such as Kabash, Pukë, Kukël, Gocaj, Barbullush, Mal i Jushit, Torovicë and Sumë, sparing no effort to reconcile many people avoiding revenge and offering his testimony. This testimony profoundly moved Pope Francis during his visit to Tirana on September 21, 2014, when they met and embraced in the cathedral of that city. On September 20, 2016, during the vist to Assisi, he sat at the table next to the pope.
Episcopate. He declined episcopal consecration because of age.
Cardinalate. Created cardinal deacon in the consistory of November 19, 2016; received the red biretta, the cardinalitial ring and the deaconry of Santa Maria della Scala in that same consistory. He had reached age 80 before becoming a cardinal, therefore, he was not eligible to participate in a conclave. Took possession of his deaconry on February 12, 2017. On July 15, 2017, the Pope named him special papal envoy to the consecration of the church dedicated to Saint Teresa of Calcutta in the city of Pristina, Apostolic Administration of Prizren, Kosovo, programmed for September 5, 2017. He was named honorary canon of the metropolitan cathedral chapter of Florence when he turned ninety years old in October 2018.

(64) 2. MENDONÇA, José Tolentino Calaça de
(1965-
Birth. Deember 15, 1965, Island of Madeira, Portugal. He was the youngest of five children, spending his early years in Angola, where his father was a fisherman. During that time, he witnessed seeing a man killed in cold blood. There were armed groups. They lived on the run on a boat far from land for several days. The family returned to Portugal when he was nine years old.
Education. He obtained a licentiate in theology from the Universidade Católica Portuguesa in Lisbon in 1989; and a licentiate in biblical sciences at the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome in 1992. He obtained a doctorate in biblical theology from the Universidade Católica Portuguesa in Lisbon in 2004.
Priesthood. Ordained, July 28, 1990, for the diocese of Funchal, Madeira, by Bishop Teodoro de Faria, bishop of Funchal. He has served as lecturer at the diocesan seminary of Funchal; rector of the Pontifical Portuguese College in Rome; vice rector and lecturer at the Universidade Católica Portuguesa in Lisbon; and visiting lecturer at the Catholic Universities of Pernambuco and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and at the Faculty of Philosophy and Theology of Belo Horizonte, Brazil. In addition, he has served as consultor of the Pontifical Council for Culture since 2011. He preached the Lent Retreat to the Roman Curia on February 18 to 23, 2018, in Ariccia.

His episcopal motto is Considerate Lilia Agri. He is a Portuguese theologian and poet who’s made a career out of engaging secular thought and who, prior to his nomination by Pope Francis as the archivist and librarian of the Holy Roman Church, rarely was seen wearing clerical clothes, exuding a spirit of simplicity akin to the pontiff himself.
Cardinalate. Created cardinal deacon in the consistory of October 5, 2019; received the red biretta, the cardinalitial ring and the deaconry of Santi Domenico e Sisto in that same consistory. Took possession of his deaconry on Sunday December 15, 2019. On February 21, 2020, the pope named him member of the Pontifical Council for Culture.

On April 30, 2022, he was named member of the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints. On July 13, 2022, the Holy Father named him member of the Dicastery for Bishops. On September 26, 2022, the Holy Father named him prefect of the Dicastery for Culture and Education. To succeed him as archivist and librarian of the Holy Roman Church, the pope named Angelo Vincenzo Zani, titular archbishop of Volturno, secretary of the then Congregation for Catholic Education.

Among his teachers was Jesuit theologian Bernard Lonergan. This was the time of the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965) which provided the opportunity of attending lectures by theologians such as Karl Rahner and Yves Congar, future Cardinal. He completed his doctorate in Theology in 1965 on the missionary intention in the writings of the Latin apologists. In 1965 he started a BA in Arabic at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London, graduating in 1968, whereupon he became a lecturer at the IPEA (Institut Pontifical d'Études Arabes), later renamed the Pontifical Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies (PISAI).

In 1978, he returned to Africa to carry out parish work in Sudan, in the town of New Halfa (Archdiocese of Khartoum). His duties included ministering to the Christian population while also cooperating with the Muslim community. In 1980, he was elected to the General Council of the Missionaries of Africa in Rome, where he spent six years managing and organizing. On January 22, 1987, he was appointed secretary of the then Secretariat for Non-Christians, called since 1988 Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue (PCID).

He spent his prison term in the labor camps of Perm and Mordovia. In 1988, he was exiled to Siberia. Thanks to liberalization of Soviet politics caused by perestrojka, Father Tamkevičius was set free.

(75) 13. DAL CORSO, P.S.D.P., Eugenio
(1939-
Birth. May 16, 1939, Lugo di Valpantena di Grezzana, diocese of Verona, Italy. He was the second of the six children of Rodolfo Dal Corso and Teresa Bellorio; he was given the name Eugenio to honor Pope Pius XII who had been elected Pope two months earlier.
Education. From the age of ten he attended the Don Calabria Institute and there decided to become a missionary. He made his religious profession in the Poor Servants of the Divine Providence (P.S.D.P.) religious congregation in 1956. The Congregation is also called the Saint John Calabria Congregation.
Priesthood. Ordained, July 7, 1963, in the Casa di Nazareth. He then completed his studies in dogmatics while he also was doing pastoral work in the Madonna di Campagna parish in Verona as well as in Naples. He also taught theology from 1967 to 1968. He began his career as a missionary in the city of Laferrere in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, in January 1975, where he helped educate new priests. After just over a decade there, he was assigned to the missions in Luanda, Angola, in March 1986. One of his projects there was the construction of a seminary in Uíje. In 1991 he was appointed the Provincial Superior of his Order in Angola.
Episcopate. Elected coadjutor bishop of Saurimo, Angola, December 15, 1995. Consecrated, March 3, 1996, by Félix del Blanco Prieto, titular archbishop of Vannida, apostolic delegate to Angola, assisted by Andrea Veggio, titular bishop of Velia, auxiliary bishop of Verona, Italy, and by Pedro Marcos Ribeiro da Costa, bishop of Saurimo. His episcopal motto is Sapientia. Succeeded to the see of Saurimo, January 15, 1997. He was sent to Cabinda in July 2005 to become apostolic administrator of the diocese. On July 18, he was beaten while preparing to celebrate Mass at the church of the Immaculate Conception and had to be taken to the hospital. Bishop Dal Corso responded by shutting the parish and suspending its pastor, Father Jorge Casimiro Congo. After local priests, including Cabinda's vicar general Father Raul Tati, protested against this move by writing to the Vatican with a request for Bishop Dal Corso's resignation, Bishop Dal Corso dismissed Father Tati from his position. Many Cabindan clergy went on strike in solidarity with the suspended priests and refused to celebrate Mass. While CEAST stated that it held the priests “completely” responsible for not celebrating Mass, Father Congo responded that no dialogue had been held with the Cabindan clergy and people. Meanwhile, the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda stated that it held CEAST responsible for the confrontation and implied that the bishops' conference was being manipulated by the Angolan government. Papal nuncio Giovanni Angelo Becciu emphasized that Bishop Vieira Dias's nomination was a matter of papal prerogative and would not be revoked. He came to Cabinda in order to meet with Bishop Dal Corso, and while he held a “fraternal” meeting with Cabindan priests, his meeting with laypeople was "hostile" and his car was stoned by a crowd. At the beginning of December 2005, an accord for the resumption of the celebration of Masses was reached. By the end of March 2006, the Episcopal Conference of Angola and São Tomé (CEAST) declared that the religious life of the Cabinda diocese was back to normal. Transferred to the see of Benguela, February 18, 2008. Resigned the pastoral government of the diocese of Benguela, March 26, 2018, for age limits. Strong in his missionary vocation, and still feeling in good health, he chose nevertheless not to withdraw, but to continue working on the front line in the diocese of Menongue, one of the most needy in Angola. On July 22, 2018 the apostolic administrator, Pío Hipunyati, appointed him chaplain of the pastoral center of Saint Josefina Bakhita of Caiundo, a small community in the province of Kuando Kubango, in the south of the country, 130 kilometers from the capital. He announced that he will immediately return to Caiundo to continue his service to the poorest.
Cardinalate. Created cardinal priest in the consistory of October 5, 2019; received the red biretta, the cardinalitial ring and the title of Sant’Anastasia in that same consistory. He was older than eighty years at the time of his promotion to the cardinalate and thus not eligible to participate in a conclave. He is the first cardinal of his religious congregation. He plans to continue working in the diocese of Benguela. He took possession of his title on November 17, 2019.

(98) 10. CANTONI, Oscar
(1950-
Birth. September 1, 1950, Lenno, province and diocese of Como, Italy. He moved with his family to the nearby village of Tremezzo at the age of eight.
Education. After having frequented the Liceo Classico at Collegio Gallio of Como of the Somaschan Fathers and obtained the maturity, he entered the Seminary of Como to start the courses of theology which he completed brilliantly. He collaborated with the Riviste di spiritualità, in which he published articles about vocations. He also published several books for the youth. He has no academic degrees, but has always continued to keep up to date in the cultural field.
Priesthood. Ordained, June 28, 1975, in the cathedral of Como, by Teresio Ferraroni, bishop of Como. During his priestly ministry he was from 1985 to 1986 responsible at the seminary of the vocational animation; collaborator in the parish of S. Maria Regina a Como; chaplain of the Sisters at Collegio S. Chiara in Muggiò; from 1986 to 1999, he was director of the Vocational Diocesan Center and professor of religion in the secondary schools of Como; from 1990 to 2005, he was spritual director of the theological students in the Diocesan Seminary; preacher of spiritual exercises to priests and founder in the diocese of the Ordo Virginum, an association of consecrated virgins restored by the Second Vatican Council, which contributed to the birth and development of the diocese of Como. On July 11, 2000, he was named prelate of honor of His Holiness. From 2003 to 2005, he was episcopal vicar for the clergy of Como.
Episcopate. Elected bishop of Crema, January 25, 2005. Consecrated, March 5, 2005, at the cathedral of Como, by Alessandro Maggiolini, bishop of Como, assisted by Tersio Ferraroni, bishop emeritus of Como, and by Paolo Romeo, titular archbishop of Vulturia, apostolic nuncio to Italy. His episcopal moto is Fare di Cristo il Cuore del Mondo. On November 21, 2010 he received the insignia of grand officer of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre and was appointed the grand prior of the lieutenancy for Northern Italy by decree of Cardinal John Patrick Foley, grand master of the order. Transferred to the see of Como, October 4, 2016; he took possession of the see the following November 27. He is delegate for the vocational pastoral and the seminaries of the Lombardian Episcopal Conference. On August 31, 2017, during the celebrations for the solemnity of Sant'Abbondio, he announced the celebration of the eleventh diocesan synod of Como, entitled "Witnesses and heralds of God's mercy"; after having inaugurated it, on January 12, 2020, he presided over the concluding Eucharistic celebration on June 4, 2022. He has drawn criticism for his role in a pre-seminary sponsored by the Como diocese, previously located on Vatican grounds until it was moved by Pope Francis, in which abuse allegedly occurred. He was summoned to testify before a Vatican tribunal in February 2021 in the case, among other things about his role in ordaining one of the alleged (but eventually acquitted) abuser to the priesthood. The court found that while there was clearly a sexualized atmosphere in the pre-seminary, it wasn’t proven the behavior at issue constituted abuse. For his part, he conceded that he had received negative reports about the future priest between 2006 and 2012, but he described them merely as evidence of a “transitory homosexual tendency linked to adolescence.” On July 13, 2022, the Holy Father named him member of the Dicastery for Bishops.

(1) Derived from Sanskrit, the word “Dalit” means "broken" or “downtrodden,” and refers to those so low in social status that they are considered outcasts or outside the four-tier caste system of Hindu society. Often referred to as “untouchables,” these people have been greatly exploited and subject to atrocities. Dalits make up around 25 percent of the total population in India. However, they are roughly 50-75 percent of all Christians in India, and between 60-75 percent of Catholics.
