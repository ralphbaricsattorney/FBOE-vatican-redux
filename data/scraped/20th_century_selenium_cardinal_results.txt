(1) LeBlanc, Dictionnaire bigraphique des évêques catholiques du Canada, p. 242, indicates that he obtained the doctorate at the Gregorian University, Rome, but Hierarchia Catholica Medii et Recentioris Aevi, VIII, 411, says that he obtained it at the University of Ottawa, Canada, to which Fr. Leblanc adds that the degree was honoris cause.
(2) According to LeBlanc, Dictionnaire bigraphique des évêques catholiques du Canada, p. 243, the Manitobaine laws of 1870 removed the school rights of the Catholic minority and abrogated the official status of French. In 1896, the federal government, directed by the Conservative Sir Charles Tupper, had been prevented, because of the systematic obstruction of the Liberal party, from adopting the law répatratrice, and had to call elections. They were won, on June 23, in spite of the intervention of the bishops Québécois, by the Liberals of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, who concluded, in November, the agreement called Laurier-Greenway, with the government of Manitoba. The agreement, while not restoring separate schools, authorized religious and bilingual teaching under restrictive conditions, but the nationalists were not satisfied and caused a division within the Church and, at the request of the federal government, an apostolic delegate was sent. The federal government specified its preference to the S.C. for the Propagation of the Faith: an emissary of English culture who spoke French and knew the British institutions.
(3) According to LeBlanc, Dictionnaire bigraphique des évêques catholiques du Canada pp. 243-244, his nomination strongly displeased the Québécois episcopate, which saw in it a lack of confidence on the part of the Holy See. The Canadian-French bishops received him rather coldly and were far from eager to collaborate with him. The prospects for the two sides to reconcile were not very good. The delegate, imbued of the hope (and of the illusion) prevalent in the Roman Curia at the time, hoped to bring back the Anglo-Saxon world into the flock of the church; he judged that it was better to prevent raising protests of fanaticism and sacrificing a small minority of French language than run the risk of reprisals against the Catholic minorities in Ontario and in les Maritime, which were of English language. He believed that the problem was not about a conflict between two political parties, but between Catholics and Protestants; that the attitude of the Conservative Party had been hypocritical, electoralist and more guilty that the Liberal Party, leaving the problem to the courts, and being slow in adopting a reparation law. The bishops for their part, thought that the delegate was too reconciling and that he had been deceived by promises, which were to confirm the future, because no legislative measurement was introduced, but only administrative arrangements, and the temporary solution of Laurier would become permanent. They estimated that the delegate understood the historical context very badly, defended the constitutional rights, and argued that to yield on this question would possibly produce the disappearance of the rights of the minorities in North and the West, which indeed was carried out. Presented by the most radical as anglophile and even hostile to the French culture, even if he spoke French as well as English and Italian, he was completely surrounded by the Irish bishops and the governmental mediums, met First Minister Laurier, was received by Governor General Lord Aberdeen, was celebrated by the liberal government of Ontario, and concluded that the adversaries of the agreement Greenway-Laurier (Msgr. Langevin and the majority of the bishops Québécois) were too close to the Conservative Party and lacked political direction. The Vatican, by the encyclical Affari vos of December 8, 1897, disapproved the agreement as imperfect because it promoted the neutral schools, while recommending to the Catholics to accept these partial satisfactions. The Canadian-French bishops had finally to subject themselves. The majority of the historians recognize that the mission of Msgr. Merry del Val paved the way for the establishment of a permanent delegation in Canada, which he recommended as the best means of uniting the episcopate and of establishing harmonious relationships with the civil authorities.
(4) He had written "On my tomb is to be only my name and the words 'Da Mihi Animas Coetera Tolle', the aspiration of my entire life". According to his wishes, his sarcophagus has the following simple text :
RAPHAEL CARD. MERRY DEL VAL

Note. The inscription indicates that he died in August but all the sources consulted say that he died in July.

Transferred to the titular see of Batne, January 19, 1913, because "Danaba" has an undignified quality in Arabic ears. In 1918, because of the difficulties of the Christians in parts of the Ottoman Empire, Bishop Tappouni was arrested by the Turkish authorities and accused of treason; he was court-martialed without a regular trial, and imprisoned in Aleppo under threat of execution. Angelo Maria Dolci, titular archbishopric of Gerapoli, apostolic delegate in Istanbul, obtained a stay of execution; and Empress Zita of Austria, upon the request of Pope Benedict XV, arranged for the Austrian ambassador to Turkey to also intervene and the bishop was released on October 7 of that year, at the time that the English and French troops were occupying Syria. In the following years, he worked tirelessly helping the survivors of the massacres. Vicar in Aleppo, Syria, 1919. Promoted to the see of Aleppo of the Syrians, February 24, 1921.

Participated in the conclave of 1963, which elected Pope Paul VI.

(55) 4. MAGLIONE, Luigi
(1877-1944)
Birth. March 2, 1877, Casoria, archdiocese of Naples, Italy. Son of Nicola Maglione and Maria Gaetana Cortese. His brother Domenico was provost curate of the parish of S. Mauro Abate in Casoria.
Education. Resided at Collegio Capranica, Rome, while studying at the Pontifical Gregorian University, Rome, where he obtained doctorates in philosophy in 1898 and in theology in 1902; and later, in 1904, obtained a doctorate in canon law at the Pontifical Roman Athenaeum "S. Apollinare"; finally, from 1905 to 1907, he attended the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy, Rome, where he studied diplomacy.
Priesthood. Ordained, July 25, 1901, church of S. Apollinare, Rome, by Giuseppe Ceppetelli, titular patriarch of Costantinople, vice-gerent of Rome. Pastoral ministry in Casoria, from 1901 until 1905, next to his brother Domenico, who was provost curate of the parish of S. Mauro. On May 5, 1905, he returned to Rome as vice-pastor of the Testaccio area, collaborating also in the Roman countryside with the spiritual assistance to the local population. Further studies in Rome from 1905 to 1907. Entered the service of the Secretariat of State in 1908 as addetto in the Congregation for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs; he became minutante on January 21, 1909. Privy chamberlain of His Holiness, June 17, 1910; reappointed, September 7, 1914. In those years he also taught diplomacy at the Academy of Ecclesiastical Nobles, from 1908 to 1918; and was repeater of theology in Collegio Leonino from 1910 to 1913. From 1912 to 1918, he was also spiritual director at Collegio Capranica. Domestic prelate of His Holiness, February 22, 1918. Provisional papal representative to the League of Nations in 1918. Named papal representative before the Swiss Confederation on February 25, 1918. The activities carried out by the representatives of Holy See, in particular, the collaboration of Catholic institutions with Switzerland in the fields of health care and charity work during the war and after the war, helped to promote official resumption of diplomatic relations between the Holy See and Switzerland, which had been interrupted since 1873. In June 1920, the Swiss Federal Council decided on the resumption of diplomatic relations with the Holy See. One month later, the Holy See decreed the restoration of the nunciature and proceeded to the appointment of Monsignor Maglione as apostolic nuncio in Berne.
Episcopate. Elected titular archbishop of Cesarea di Palestina and appointed nuncio before the Swiss Confederation, September 1, 1920. Consecrated, September 26, 1920, basilica of S. Maria in Trastevere, Rome, by Cardinal Pietro Gasparri, secretary of State, assisted by Bonaventura Cerretti, titular archbishop of Corinto, secretary of the S C. for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, and by Lorenzo Schioppa, titular archbishop of Mocisso, nuncio in Hungary. In the same ceremony was consecrated Francesco Marmaggi, titular archbishop of Adrianopoli di Emimonto and nuncio in Rumania, future cardinal. His episcopal motto was Fides et labor. Named nuncio in France, June 23, 1926; he arrived in Paris on the following November 3. He devoted himself especially to the renewal of the French episcopate; most of the French bishops, appointed by Pope Pius X after the rupture of the Concordat between France and Holy See, were characterized by a conservative and monarchist orientation, and some had sometimes shown sympathy for the reactionary movement Action Française. The nuncio suggested to Rome the choice of authoritative personalities with advanced social ideas and sensitive to the democratic values; this new direction was welcomed by democratic circles in France. During the period of his nunciature in Paris, he had to contend with the differences between the Holy See and Action Française. On December 20 1926, Pope Pius XI, in his consistorial address, deplored the movement Action Française and on December 29 was published the decree of condemnation by the S. C. of the Holy Office. For its firm position against the movement of Charles Maurras, Nuncio Maglione was severely attacked by the Action Française; in 1932, the organ of the movement accused him of being a spy in the service of Germany when he was in Switzerland during the war and challenged him hard in Marseille during a conference of students. Because of the disagreement between Rome and the movement, Cardinal Louis Billot, S.J., resigned his cardinalate. In January 1932, in his address of congratulations to Paul Doumer, president of France, the nuncio pointed out the problems that invested the international economy in the context of the Great Depression that followed the collapse of Wall Street, denouncing the "economic malaise" which hardly affected all nations, and calling on governments to "take special measures in favor of the working class". In October 1935, he tried, without success, a diplomatic mediation with Foreign Minister Pierre Laval, in order to resolve peacefully the dispute between Italy and Ethiopia. Promoted to the cardinalate, he left Paris in July 1936.
Cardinalate. Created cardinal priest in the consistory of December 16, 1935; received the red hat and the title of S. Pudenziana, June 18, 1936. Member of the SS. CC. of the Holy Office, Consistorial, Oriental Church, Sacraments, Council, Religious, Propaganda Fide, Ceremonial, Seminaries and Universities of Study, and of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signature. Member of the commissions for biblical studies, for the preparation of the Code of Oriental Canon Law; of the oversight committee of cardinals for the papal Shrine of Pompeii and of the commission of cardinals for the administration of the goods of the Holy See, of which he was president. Prefect of the S.C. of the Council, July 22, 1938 to March 10, 1939. Participated in the conclave of 1939, which elected Pope Pius XII. At the strong request of the French bishops, he was named secretary of State on March 10, 1939; occupied the post until his death (1). His appointment found wide acceptance, especially in international democratic circles, which saw him as a skilled diplomat, personally sensitive to democratic values and hostile to totalitarianism. In his new charge, he availed himself extensively of the collaboration of the secretary for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, Monsignor Domenico Tardini; and the substitute for Ordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, Monsignor Giovanni Battista Montini, future Pope Paul VI. They carried the government of the Church in the difficult and troubled years of World War II, making every effort to keep the Holy See on a level of neutrality and impartiality, trying, especially at the beginning of the war, to achieve a diplomatic mediation with the aim of arriving at a peaceful settlement of the conflict. Named grand chancellor of the Pontifical Institute of Christian Archeology on May 5, 1939. On December 29, 1939, he was decorated by King Vittorio Emanuele III with the knightly Order of the Annunziata. He realized a particularly intense diplomatic effort, with the objective of removing the risk of a European war. He completed the last attempt on August 31, 1939, on the eve of the German attack on Poland, summoning the ambassadors of Germany, France, Italy, Poland, Spain and England. He tried to prevent the entry of Italy in the war; and after the fall of France, he tried, without success, a new diplomatic mediation. The diplomatic initiatives of the Holy See in favor of peace were never able to find concrete chance of success, which Cardinal Maglione realized. He paid a particular attention to the Polish question, especially in the face of the sudden persecution of Catholics after the Nazi occupation. He also faced the problem of the anti-Semitic persecution carried out by the Nazis. Cardinal Maglione, in the name of the pope, took steps to mitigate the racial laws, especially in favor of the "Jewish converts," to secure the release of the interned Jews, improve prison conditions, pay financial aid to families, encourage the formation of national committees for aid to refugees, obtain immigration visas for North and South America. Cardinal Maglione expressed several times the impression that the Nazis were taking repressive initiatives that went beyond "the necessities of war", in front of which the Holy See could not long remain silent. After the raid carried out by the Germans in the ghetto of Rome on the night between October 15 and 16, 1943, the cardinal summoned the German ambassador, Ernst von Weizsdcker, and asked him to intervene "in the name of humanity, of Christian charity." He added that the pope was "painful beyond words that it was in Rome, under the eyes of the common Father, that so many people were made to suffer, only because they belonged to a particular race. Notable was also the commitment of the cardinal to ward off the raids on Italian cities, trying in vain to get the declaration of Rome as an "open city." After the fall of Fascism and the birth of the Italian Social Republic (RSI), Cardinal Maglione specified that the Holy See could not recognize the new state, as it was established norm not to recognize "de jure" governments that were formed during the war because of the war, when there was already a legal government. He went to Casoria to take thermal bath treatments, almost immediately after the Allies occupied Rome, and until his death, he was kept under the supervision of American doctors.
Death. August 22, 1944, at 4 a.m., of a heart attack from neuritis and circulatory ailments (he was a heavy smoker), in his birthplace, Casoria, near Naples. Buried in the chapel of S. Mauro Abate of the parish-collegiate church of S. Mauro Abate, Casoria (2). After his death, Pope Pius XII decided not to appoint a new secretary of State for the rest of his pontificate.

(1) It is traditional in Toledo that the body of the dead cardinals be taken on the 14th century stretcher that was used to transport the body of Cardinal Gil de Albronoz from Italy to Toledo; the funeral procession follows the same path of the procession of Corpus Christi but in reverse order. All of this was observed in the funeral of Cardinal Gomá.

(1) Lesourd, Eugene Cardinal Tisserant., p. 7, cites Cardinal Tisserant: "The whooping cough which I caught when I was only five years old, was decisive for my future. I was quarantined at home, and my father, who did not want anybody to lose time, got it into his ahead to teach me to read by the syllable method. The system wasn't bad at all; when I returned to school I was one year ahead of everybody else."
(2) Among them the New York Public Library; the Columbia University Library; the J. P. Morgan Library; the Princeton University Library; the New Free Library of Philadelphia; the University of Pennsylvania Library; the Johns Hopkins University Library;the Library of Congress, the Notre Dame University Library and the library of the University of Illinois. In his report to the Vatican, quoted by Lesourd, Eugene Cardinal Tisserant., p. 24-25, he said "As different as the American libraries are from one another --the Library of Congress which was created for the needs of the members of the legislature and has become the central library of the nation; the municipal libraries, which seek to spread instruction among the people, to raise the general moral and intellectual level; the university libraries, whose personnel go out of their way to prepare for both professor and students the tools of research and instruction; the collectors' libraries, founded by enlightened amateurs and always to be preferred to the other kinds because, thanks to generous foundation grants, they are at the disposal of specialists-- they all seemed to me to be dominated by that principle of usefulness which characterizes all American organizations. If in Europe there are so many 'dead' libraries, which collectors and city institutions hold in such high esteem, it is because on this continent it is the book which holds the first place in consideration. In America, the reader is more important to the librarian than the book. Hence, the system of lending from library to home, which surprises us; likewise, the policy of the open shelf, stacks accessible to an enormous number of readers if not to all, where even children begin their apprenticeship; hence also the dictionary catalogue, which not only helps one find a book one knows but also suggests related titles; and finally, the preoccupation with the improvement of services, on the grounds that the capital invested in a library should bear fruit in noble and widespread instruction." His second visit took place in 1933 to attend the convention of the American Library Association in Chicago and a reunion of the International Library Committee; in 1947, he returned to the United States to receive an honorary doctorate of laws degree from Princeton University in company with General Dwight D. Eisenhower; he took advantage of the trip to make a lecture tour around the country which netted him $40,000 for the completion of the construction of the cathedral of his suburbicarian diocese; in 1950, he made yet another trip to America, starting in Canada and ending in the United States, where he visited the Grand Canyon.
(3) The motu proprio Suburbicariis sedibus, issued by Pope John XXIII on April 11, 1962, established that the cardinal bishops would have no ordinary jurisdiction over their suburbicarian sees. These dioceses were to be ruled by bishops with complete and independent ordinary power; cardinal bishops would only retain the title of the see. The disposition applied only to the cardinal bishops appointed in 1961 and later. The others, Cardinals Eugène Tisserant, Clemente Micara, Benedetto Aloisi Masella and Giuseppe Pizzardo, retained the denomination of bishops of their sees. On November 17, 1966, they were listed as bishops of the title of their suburbicarian sees in Annuario Pontificio per l'anno 1967, except Cardinal Micara, who had died in 1965.

(1) At 12, he interrupted his schooling to work for an estate agent. At 13, he became a GPO messenger boy; the following year, he was promoted to the telegraphic division; two years later, he was assigned as postal assistant at Bourke, 500 miles north-west of Sydney; when the First World War erupted, he wanted to enlist but he was under 18 and his parents refused; at that time, he was a relieving telegraphist at Narrabri; when wireless operators became urgently needed to staff the troops transports leaving for Europe, his opportunity came because parental consent was not necessary in such cases; he applied immediately, was given an extended leave of absence without pay by the Post and Telegraph Department and became a junior wireless operator on the troop ship "Hessen" that left Sydney in January 1915 for Egypt and later Gallipoli. The ship, carrying 400 Sikh troops of the 26th Indian Mountain Gun Battery and their weapons, lay offshore at Gallipoli for three weeks during the great disaster; he kept a detailed personal diary of the experience; after leaving Gallipoli, he arrived in London and returned to Australia nine months after he had left; the Post and Telegraph Department sent him to Lismore, New South Wales. There he came under the influence of the cathedral administrator, Monsignor Terence McGuire, founding president of the Manly Union, an association of priests from St. Patrick's College who wanted the "Australianization" of the Australian Church. McGuire asked Gilroy if he had thought of the priesthood. He replied that he had, but had rejected it on the grounds of his own unsuitability and his family's financial straits. McGuire reassured him on the first point and promised to find a way around the second. In 1917, Norman went to St. Columba's Seminary and Foreign Missionary College in Springwood, to begin studies for the priesthood. .

(1) This is the text of his spiritual testament, taken from "Ha muerto el cardenal primado," Ecclesia, July 13, 1968, p. 17:
"Siendo cierta la muerte de todo hombre, y sólo inciertos el modo y momento, y disponiendo el ceremonial de los obispos que éstos, en vida y en muerte, adoctrinen con su ejemplo y con su palabra a los fieles que tienen encomendados; no sabiendo si estaré en estado de poder en la hora de mi muerte hacer mi última exhortación pastoral a mis amadísimos sacerdotes y fieles toledanos, la escribo en estos dmas en que me hallo retirado practicando ejercmcios espirituales en compañía de otros hermanos en el Episcopado.
Carísimos sacerdotes a quienes consagré ministros del Señor o a quienes consagrados ya por alguno de mis antecesoras, me tocó presidir como obispo: recordad siempre que fuisteis ordenados sacerdotes para estar al servicio de Dios y de las almas; para ello necesitáis conservar siempre vuestra vida interior y aun ir creciendo en ella; debéis dar ejemplo de santidad a los fieles con vuestra vida inmaculada, con vuestro desinterés, con vuestro espíritu de caridad y de abnegado y ardiente celo por la salvación de las almas.
Carísimos fieles: procurad ante todo la salvación de vuestras almas, que para esto os ha puesto Dios en este mundo, en una vida temporal, muy breve siempre comparada con la vida eterna. No dejéis el cumplimiento de vuestros deberes religiosos, pues sin él no seréis reconocidos como verdaderas cristianos en el día del juicio.
Mujeres: no seáis con vuestra inmodestia responsables del los pecados de los hombres.
Padres de familia: cuddad de la cristiana educación y vigilancia de vuestros hijos. Los que tenéis riquezas no olvidéis los deberes de caridad que ellas imponen.
Patronos y empresarios: no os hagáis responsables de injusticias no dando salarios suficientes a vuestros obreres o poniendo precios excesivos a vuestras mercancías.
Obreros: no os despojéis de vuestra gran dignidad de hijos de Dios, ante el cual gozáis de plena igualdad con los que ante los hombres temporalmente os aventajan, seducidos por la fantástica igualdad que predica el comunismo, convertida, si triunfa. en despótica tiranía que atropella la dignidad de la persona humana.
Estos son los últimos consejos de quien ha sido padre de vuestras almas y que ahora os pide una oración por la suya.
En Los Negrales, a 3 de julio de 1961. Enrique, Cardenal Pla y Deniel, arzobispo de Toledo."

(1) Text of his spiritual testament, taken from Gambio, Il pastore sulla breccia, Ernesto card. Ruffini, p. 263:

   Innanzitutto ringrazio di tutto cuore il Signore per i molteplici favori e grandi doni che mi ha elargito, specialmente chiamandomi al Sacerdozio e alla pienezza del Sacerdozio; ci vorrà l'eternità perchè io possa effondere meno inadeguatamente la mia riconoscenza per gli innumerevoli benefizi ricevuti dalla misericordia di Dio per la mediazione della mia dolcissima Madre celeste, Maria Santissima.
   Ringrazio pure tutti coloro che mi hanno aiutato con l'opera, con l'esempio, con la preghiera.
   Chiedo umilmente perdono al Signore dei miei peccati, delle offese recateGli e delle negligenze commesse nel suo servizio.
Professo fede fermissima a quanto il Signore ha rivelato e la Santa Chiesa Apostolica Romana propone da credere.
   Ho consacrato molti anni allo studio della Sacra Scrittura e confesso di averne tratto sempre maggior conferma della mia Fede e impulso a bene operare.
Rinnovo la mia profunda, commossa devozione alla Ss. Eucaristia e alla Madonna, alla quale mi sono consacrato con un voto speciale da più di cinquanta anni.
   Approvo pienamente e confermo con entusiasmo gli altri tre voti, da me emessi con l'approvazione del veneratissimo Mons. Vincenzo Tarozzi (+ 1918), di castità perfetta, di umiltà (non cercare mai onori, ed accettarli soltanto quando risultassero con certezza di maggior gloria di Dio) e di perfezione.
   Chiedo umilmente perdono a quanti avessi offeso, recato loro molestia, o dato cattivo esempio. Per parte mia non ho nulla da perdonare: amo tutti coloro che ho conosciuto, e raggiungendo per divina bontà il Paradiso, tutti porterò con me e mi interesserò della loro salvezza eterna, onde stare poi sempre in loro compagnia beatamente.
   Ho sempre amato la povertà -- sono fin da giovane Sacerdote Terziario Cappuccino -- e godo di morire senza proprietà alcuna di beni immobili, povero per i miei poveri, che tanto da vicino mi rappresentano Gesù Cristo, mio dolce Salvatore.
   Il Seminario e i Sacerdoti hanno formato la pupilla dei miei occhi. Se i Sacerdoti saranno tutti buoni, uomini di orazione e perfettamente obbedienti al loro Arcivescovo, faranno miracoli e l'Archidiocesi di Palermo (con l'Eparchia), attesa l'eccezionale bontà del suo popolo, diventerà presto esemplare sotto ogni aspetto.
   Dopo il Seminario e il Clero mi sta sommamente a cuore l'Istituto delle Assistenti Sociali Missionarie, da me fondato. Credo mi sia stato ispirato dalla Madonna, che ne è e ne sarà sempre la suprema Direttrice e Moderatrice: esso risponde certamente a una grande necessità dei tempi nostri nel vasto campo dell'apostolato cristiano. Considero le Assistenti Sociali Missionarie vere Madri Sociali nel nome del Redentore divino Gesù Cristo. Esse potranno entrare in tutti i settori sociali, per portare ovunque lo spirito dell'Evangelo e per preparare innumerevoli anime al sacro ministero dei Sacerdoti. È però assolutamente necessario che siano animate tutte e singole di grande spirito di orazione, di mortificazione e di carità.
   Desidero essere sepolto -- se nulla oster` -- nella Chiesa della Madonna dei Rimedi, presso l'altare della Madonna, a sinistra di chi La guarda.

(2) This is the text of the eulogy (taken from Gambio, Il pastore sulla breccia, Ernesto card. Ruffini, p. 251-252), which was composed by Msgr. Salvatore Cambria, chancellor of the archiepiscopal Curia, and subscribed by Filippo Aglialoro, titular bishop of Germa di Galazia, auxiliary and vicar general of Palermo, by the metropolitan chapter and by the civil authorities and others:

ERNESTUS RUFFINI, die XIX m. ianuarii anni millesimi octingentesimi octuagesimi octavi in oppido vulgo " S. Benedetto Po " dioecesis Mantuanae natus, inde a pueritia sacerdotalia munera percupiit.
    Studiorum curriculo emenso et laurea doctorali donatus, die decima m. iulii a. MCMX primum sacrum litavit. Castitatem ex voto inde a teneris annis illaesam servavit et coluit, pietate in Deum enituit, eximia devotione erga Beatissimam Virginem flagravit.
    A Sancto Pio X, cui apprime carus fuit, integra valetudine donatus, ipse munus docendi Sacram Scripturam in Pont. Seminario ad Lateranum accepit, quod postea in Pont. Athenaeo Urbaniano cumulavit, donec a Pio Pp. XI "a Secretis Sacrae Congregationis de Seminariis et Studiorum Universitatibus" renuntiatus fuit. Quo in munere multa egregia navavit ad studia ecclesiastica provehenda, eiusque opera et ingenio prodiit Const. Apost. "Deus scientiarum Dominus".
    Quem virum, tantis decoratum animi ornamentis, Pius XII Pontifex Maximus, anno MCMXLV, in lesto Divinae Maternitatis, ad cathedram S. Mamiliani evexit, asserens se nihil melius habere in Urbe ut Panormum ditaret. Inter Purpuratos Patres cooptatus, die XXXI m. martii anni subsequentis Fanormum venit ac, inenarrabili laetitia exceptus, omnium animos sibi devinxit, immo ipse devinctus est. Felix enim urbs, teterrimo bello vix exstincto, innumera vulnera prae se ferebat, ubique erat squalidior egestas. Propterea effecit ut Fanormum re "felicis urbis" appellationem iterum consequeretur.
    Boni Pastoris officio optime functus est; quater universam archidioecesim lustravit; ministerium verbi, doctrina et facundia, mire exercuit; Seminarium Archiepiscopale, sive maius sive minus, novis aptisque aedificiis ditavit, ac, ad peculiarem institutionem neo-mystarum, Institutum Pastorale a sancto Curato d'Ars nuncupatum, excitavit et amplificavit; inopes effusa caritate et summa liberalitate fovit.
    In postulationes temporum intentus, Institutum saeculare " Assistenti Sociali Missionarie " fundavit, quod, rite ab Ecclesia probaturo, fines archidioeceseos cum praetergressum esser, peculiarem apostolatum exercet in plures dioeceses Italiae, Hispaniae et Americae Latinae.
    Compiorati Erm.mi Praesulis alacritas omnino mira fuit, tum in partes Ecclesiae tum in partes ad societatem hominum pertinentes. Erectis nato quadraginta novis paroeciis, affabre a fundamentis viginti ecclesias paroeciales et domus canonicas excitavit, ne verbum dicamus de ecclesiis refectis et de cura in cathedralem ecclesiam impensa.
    Praeclara monumenta caritatis ipsius erga egenos exstant quae italice nuncupantur : Villaggio Card. Ruffini - Istituto Angelo Custode - Casa della Gioia.- Villaggio dell'Ospitalità - Casa della Serenità - Centro di formazione professionale et alia. Omnibus compertum est qua alacritare interfuit Concilio Oecumenico Vaticano II, ut Christi Ecclesia, ad novum renata vigorem, efficaciore virtute salutiferum suum munus expleret.
    Die XI m. iulii a. MCMLXVII, lato suffragio ad renovandum concilium (assemblea) regionis siculae, profecturus ad sacrum faciendum in oratorio loci vulgo "Bonagia", repentino morbo correptus, sacramentis Ecclesiae refectus, pitssime animare Deo reddidit hora undecima, comploratus ab universa archidioecesi et ab bominibus cuiusvis gradus.
    Ut Summi Pontificis utar verbis "ut bonus miles Christi in acri occubuit".
    Christus ipse, intercedente Deipara Virgine, quam semper in ore et in corde gessit, Patri ac Pastori desideratissimo ianuam superni regni patefaciat, eique praemia promerita impertiat.

(1) Spending all his resources to relieve suffering, Bishop von Preysing, when he was created cardinal, had to obtain money for the trip to Rome from Archbishop Angelo Roncalli, nuncio in France. At the 1946 consistory, one of the other new cardinals tried to make small talk by remarking to Bishop von Preysing that when they died, their red hats would be suspended from the ceilings of their respective cathedrals, to which the German cardinal, thinking of his bombed out cathedral, replied, "Your Eminence forgets that I have no roof."

(1) Portmann, Cardinal von Galen, p. 58-59, relates that "Under the provisions of the then recently concluded Concordat, Clemens August, as the first bishop appointed under the Third Reich, had to take the oath of allegiance before the Prussian President of the Council of Ministers, Göring. The Bishop took a New Testament with him and, as a precaution, his pectoral cross also. And in fact there was no crucifix available at the Ministry: excuses were offered and also an assurance that next time, that was to say when another bishop was appointed, proper provision would be made. Göring, in view of the fact that this was the first swearing-in under the Concordat, read a discourse which Clemens August replied with due deliberation and according to a text that had been previously settled. After the discourses Göring gave a lunch at which he emphasized the necessity of getting the clergy on the side of National Socialism. The Bishop replied that according to the Concordat the clergy were not to take part in any party politics, to which Göring rejoined that to be a good National Socialist it was not necessary to be actually a member of the party. When in later years Göring's popularity and moderation for the time being were praised by those more intimately connected with the Bishop, he would have nothing to do with any favourable forecast; he asserted that in his view Göring was not a whir better than the rest of them. Clemens August had to pay a series of visits to the chief personages of the Reich. Adolf Hitler acknowledged his card by sending his own by post. So that he could see the grey-headed president personally, the Bishop prolonged his stay in Berlin by a day. Hindenburg inquired with interest about the Bishop's homeland; he had a dear recollection of Oldenburg from manoeuvres in the eighties of the last century; he spoke also of his being wounded at the battle of Königgrätz. When the Bishop on taking leave promised that he and his flock would pray for him, Hindenburg thanked him and asked that they should do so."
(2) According to John Allen, Anit-Nazi prelate beatified, "The word from Rome", The National Catholic Reporter, October 14, 2005, Vol. 5, No. 7, "A Nazi official, Walter Tiessler, proposed in a letter to Martin Bormann that they hang the bishop. He told Bormann he had discussed this issue with Joseph Göbbels, who said only Hitler could order such an action. Von Galen survived, but Tiessler's proposal demonstrates the risk some outspoken Catholic leaders took".
(3) His last words were: "Yes, Yes, as God wills it. May God reward you for it. May God protect the dear fatherland. Go on working for him... oh, you dear Savior!"

Then he was transferred to Shantung Province to exercise his pastoral ministry. In that area, brigands and warlords were making life difficult, but the young Father Tien demonstrated that he was fearless in face of grave danger and stayed in that province. Joined the Society of Divine Word, March 8, 1929, at the Novitiate of Steye, Holland; he took his first vows on February 2, 1931; and the final vows on March 7, 1935.

He finally went to reside at the mother-house of the Divine Word Fathers in Illinois, United States of America; from there, he continued to work tirelessly, in spite of his bad health, for the Church in China. In 1958, he went to Europe to raise funds for a seminary in Taiwan; while there, he was involved in a serious traffic accident. Soon after, Pope Pius XII died; the doctors advised against the trip to Rome for the conclave, but he went. Participated in the conclave of 1958, which elected Pope John XXIII.

Participated in the conclave of 1963, which elected Pope Paul VI. For many months before his death, he was an invalid, confined to hospital and incapable of any form of active ministry. Suffering from paralysis of the stomach and digestive area on July 22, 1967, although he had lapsed into a coma, the use of an oxygen mask caused some improvement in his condition. Archbishop Giuseppe Caprio, titular archbishop of Apollonia, apostolic pro-nuncio in India, Archbishop Paul Yü Pin of Nanking, rector of the Fu Jen Catholic University, and other church dignitaries hurried to Chiayi to be near the dying cardinal. He was the first Chinese cardinal.

Buried in the metropolitan cathedral of Taipei. A solemn requiem mass was celebrated in the cathedral, Hong Kong, at 6 p.m. on the following Monday July 31. Another solemn requiem mass was celebrated in Taipei on August 24. A hospital of which he oversaw its foundation in the Xindian area in Taipei City after raising funds in West Germany, was named after him upon its inauguration in October 1968, a year after his death.

(1897-1978)

Pro-secretary of State for Ordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, November 29, 1952 until November 1, 1954. In the consistorial allocution of January 12, 1953, Pope Pius XII announced that his two most immediate collaborators (Monsignors Domenico Tardini and Giovanni Battista Montini) had declined the promotion to the cardinalate.
Episcopate. Elected archbishop of Milan, November 1, 1954. Consecrated, December 12, 1954, patriarchal Vatican basilica, Rome, by Cardinal Eugène Tisserant, bishop of Ostia and Porto e Santa Rufina, dean of Sacred College of Cardinals, assisted by Giacinto Tredici, bishop of Brescia, and by Domenico Bernareggi, titular bishop of Famagosta and vicar capitular of Milan. Pope Pius XII was going to consecrate him but could not do it because of ill health. His episcopal motto was In nomine Domini.
Cardinalate. Created cardinal priest in the consistory of December 15, 1958; received the red hat and the title of Ss. Silvestro e Martino ai Monti, December 18, 1958. Attended the first session of the Second Vatican Council, 1962. Participated in conclave of 1963 and was elected pope.
Papacy. Elected, June 21, 1963; took name of Paul VI. Crowned, June 30, 1963, by Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani, protodeacon of S. Maria in Domnica. He continued the Second Vatican Council, which had been automatically suspended because of the death of Pope John XXIII. He issued the motu proprio Ad purpuratorum patrum on February 11, 1965, in which he stipulated that Eastern-rite patriarchs incorporated to the Sacred College of Cardinals would not belong to the clergy of Rome and consequently no title or deaconry should be assigned to them. On February 24, 1965, he issued the motu proprio Sacro Cardinalium Consilio, by which he established that the dean and sub-dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals should be elected to their posts by and from among the cardinal bishops instead of succeeding by order of seniority as had been the practice for centuries and as was legally stipulated by canon 237, paragraph one, of the Code of Canon Law of 1917. This election by the cardinal bishops requires papal confirmation to be valid. By his motu proprio Ingravescentem aetatem, dated November 21, 1970, he decided that cardinals older than eighty years were deprived of their right to elect the pope and to participate in the conclave; and that cardinals heading dicasteries in the Roman Curia were asked to submit their resignation to the pope upon reaching 75 years of age and ceased as members of the same at 80.

He created one hundred forty three cardinals in six consistories. He published six encyclicals: Ecclesiam Suam (August 6, 1964); Mense Maio (April 29, 1965); Mysterium fidei (September 3, 1965); Christi Matri (September 15, 1966); Populorum progressio (March 26, 1967); Sacerdotalis caelibatus (June 24, 1967); and Humanae vitae (July 25, 1968).

Pope Francis approved the promulgation of the decree for his beatification on May 9, 2014.

(1) The nuncio was asked to visit Ecuador on his way to enter his nunciature in Perú. The Ecuadoran government had placed as an absolute condition that the vist would have to be of a strictly private character. The nuncio entered the country as a simple tourist. He disembarked in the port of Guayaquil on August 31, 1936, and was received by civil and ecclesiastical authorities. Archbishop Carlos María de la Torre of Quito, future cardinal, went to meet him in the middle of the street in the city of Riobamba. The news of his arrival spread and provoked a festive and enthusiastic response from the population. The archbishop of Quito organized a a triumphant reception for the nuncio in that city, when he arrived at the station on September 3, 1936. The government got alarmed by the enthusiasm of the people and reminded the nuncio that he came as a private visitor and that it could not guarantee his safety. He was hosted by the Álvarez Barba family, who owned a house in the center of the city of Quito. President Federico Páez, who had probably imposed the restrictions on the visit of the nuncio, sent a high level officer of the presidency to greet the visitor the following morning. Archbishop Cento, after having celebrated mass in the Salesian church of "Cristo Rey", went personally to return the visit to the president and in the evening, he visited the foreign minister; he later went to thank the archbishop. From that day, the nuncio initiated a cordial rapport with the Catholic people of Quito and the diplomatic relations with the government, which culminated with a modus vivendi between the church and the state.

Bordeaux, le 23 janvier 1955
   J'entends mourir, quoi qu'il m'arrive et quoi qu'on puisse dire, dans la foi de l'Église catholique romaine, en pleine et entière soumission envers le Pape et en pleine et fraternelle union avec tous les évêques catholiques.
   Je déclare réprouver tout ce qui, dans mes écrits ou mes paroles, a pu être contraire à cette foi et à cette soumission, sans que je le veuille. Je regrette et rétracte toutes paroles que j'aurais pu prononcer ou écrire et qui auraient constitué un manque de respect, une médisance ou une calomnie à l'égard de mes supérieurs ou de mes collègues dans l'épiscopat.
   Je supplie que l'on me pardonne tout le tort et toute la peine que j'aurais causés aux uns et aux autres. J'offre pour eux, d'avance, toutes les souffrances que je pourrai endurer, ainsi que pour tous ceux que j'aurais pu scandaliser ou porter au mal.
   Je supplie que l'on prie beaucoup et longtemps pour moi. Car je suis écrasé à la pensée de tous les péchés que j'ai commis, de toutes les négligences dont je me suis rendu coupable. Ma vie aurait dû être bien plus féconde et bien plus édifiante !
   Je pardonne de tout coeur et sans la moindre réticence à ceux qui auraient pu me causer quelque peine.
   J'offre ma vie, mes souffrances, ma mort "pour mes péchés, pour mon diocèse, pour l'Église et pour la France ". Ce fut mon acte d'offrande perpétuel. Je les offre spéciale-ment pour mes prêtres que j'ai tant aireés et je demande très humblement pardon à ceux que j'aurais pu froisser ou contrarier.
   Je leur recommande un attachement indéfectible et délicat au Saint-Siège. Jamais je ne remercierai trop Dieu de la grâce incomparable de la formation romaine.
   Je recommande à mes prêtres l'assiduité dans l'étude des sciences sacrées, la pratique quotidienne de l'oraison mentale. Si je n'ai pas fait assez de bien et si j'ai eu tant de mouvements d'humeur, c'est parce que, dans ma vie, je n'ai pas fait assez oraison. Avec tout mon coeur, je leur recommande la dévotion ` la Sainte Vierge. C'est ma tendresse pour Marie et ma confiance dans le Coeur Sacré de Jésus qui m'auront sauvé, si Dieu veut bien me faire miséricorde.
   A mes prêtres et ` mes diocisains, je demande d'être apôtres, de correspondre aux directives de la hiérarchie en ce qui concerne l'Action Catholique, de vivre davantage suivant l'Évangile et, pour cela de pratiquer davantage le détachement. Je mourrai avec le regret de n'avoir pas été et de n'avoir pas eu le courage d'être pauvre.
   En ce moment, devant tous, je m'humilie profondément pour tout ce qu'il y a eu d'orgueilleux, de vaniteux, d'igoiste dans mes actes et mes sentiments.
   Je voudrais mourir dans l'amour le plus pur, en murmurant les mots: "Jésus ! Marie !" "

(1) During his last two years, the cardinal fought continuously for his life through several operations, spending months at the Misericordia Hospital. Although sick in bed, on one occasion taking twenty two pills a day, he kept his finger firmly on the pulse of his archdiocese by daily consultation with his secretary, the chancellor, and other officials. On Saturday morning, August 27, 1960, word went out from the chancery to the 439 parishes that Cardinal O'Hara was gravely ill. Priests and people began to offer prayers for the man they loved.

(1878-1967)
Birth. April 10, 1878, Aleppo, Syria, then under Turkish domination. Son of Rizkallah Saigh and Catherine Turkmani. His first name was Amine Rizkallah. His last name is also listed as Saïgh, Saygh and Sayegh.
Education. Initial studies at the Franciscan primary school in Aleppo; he then entered the Diocesan Seminary of Saint'Anna in Jerusalem, where he completed his secondary studies, from 1893 until 1903; he taught Arab literature at the seminary from 1903 until 1906. On July 28, 1905, he joined the Missionary Society of Saint Paul (Paulists), which had been founded by Monsignor Germanos Mouaccad in 1903; he took the name Joseph. He obtained the diploma of Hautes Études de Théologie et de Philosophie
Priesthood. Ordained, September 17, 1905, in the small church of Roumiet-el-Matn, by Melkite Patriarch Cyrill VII Sawaya of Antioch. Professor at the Seminary of Saint'Anna in Jerusalem, from 1905 to 1908. He then returned to the mother house of the society in Harissa. He preached retreats and missions, the special work of the Melkite Paulists. In 1908, he was named by Msgr. Mouaccad to assist in the Synod of the Greek Melkite Curch in Ain-Traz, Lebanon. Named director of the review Al-Maçarrat, he contributed with theological, apologetical and historical articles. Elected superior general of his religious society in 1912; occupied the post until his promotion to the episcopate.
Episcopate. Elected archbishop of Tyre of the Melkites and consecrated, August 30, 1919, Damascus, by Joseph Dimitrio Cadi, patriarch of Antioch of the Melkites, assisted by Ignace Homsi, titular bishop of Tarso of the Melkites, and by Flavien Khoury, archbishop of Homs of the Melkites. His episcopal motto was ΣΝ AIAΠE NIKA. In 1921, the Holy See designated him as apostolic visitator to the Catholic Greek Melkite communities in North America; and later, as apostolic visitator to all the Melkite religious congregations. He reorganized and built numerous schools and churches and published several liturgical works. At the death of Patriarch Cadi, the Holy See named him Locum tenes or patriarchal apostolic vicar, sede vacante, from October 30, 1925 until November 10, 1926. Transferred to the metropolitan see of Beirut and Gibail of the Melkites, August 30, 1933. In 1935, in collaboration with the Paulist missionaries, he founded the Congregation of Sœurs Missionnaires de Notre Dame du Perpétuel Secours in Daroun-Harissa, Lebanon. Named assistant at the Pontifical Throne, May 25, 1943. Elected Melkite patriarch of Antioch by the Synod of Bishops of the Melkite Church, October 30, 1947; confirmed by the pope, June 21, 1948. He had the title ad personam of the sees of Alexandria and Jerusalem of the Melkites. Attended the Second Vatican Council, 1962-1965; he spoke French instead of Latin at the council; he urged reconciliation between the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches; he championed the Eastern tradition of Christianity and won a great deal of respect from Eastern Orthodox observers at the council and the approbation of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople Athenagoras I; he also spoke forcefully against the latinization of the Eastern Catholic Churches, and urged a greater receptivity to the eastern Christian traditions, especially in the area of ecclesiology; and successfully advocated use of vernacular languages for liturgical celebrations. He was the Spiritual Protector of the international Ecumenical Military and Hospitaller Order of St. Lazarus of Jerusalem.
Cardinalate. Created cardinal patriarch in the consistory of February 22, 1965; received the red biretta, February 25, 1965. He was promoted to the cardinalate very much against his wish; three times previously he had refused a red hat on the grounds that "for a Patriarch to accept a cardinalate is treason"; Patriarchal Vicar for the See of Alexandria, Caïro and the Sudan Elias Zoghby opposed the acceptance of a Roman cardinalate by the Melkite patriarch, stating that the leader of an Eastern Catholic church should not hold a subordinate Latin-rite office; and in protest, the vicar resigned his position. The church of S. Maria in Cosmedin was assigned to him for religious celebrations while in Rome, November 22, 1965 (1).
Death. Sunday November 5, 1967, at 3:10 a.m., of cancer, in Beirut. His embalmed remains were exposed in the chapel of the archbishopric of Beirut from that day until Wednesday, when the body was transferred to the cathedral of Saint-Élie. The funeral took place on Friday November 10, 1967, at 10 a.m., in that cathedral. In attendance were the president of the Republic; the president of the Chamber; the president of the Council; Cardinal Patriarch Paul Pierre Meouchi of Antioch of the Maronites; Cardinal Patriarch Ignace-Gabriel I Tappouni of Antioch of the Syrians; numerous civil authorities; and representatives of the Orthodox, Protestant and Muslim communities. After the funeral, the body was transferred to Damascus, Syria, and exposed in the cathedral of that city. The funeral took place on Friday, November 10, at 3 p.m. Pope Paul VI sent a message of condolence through Cardinal Amleto Giovanni Cicognani, secretary of State, and asked Msgr. Atonio Petti, chargé d'affaires ad interim of the nunciature in Syria, to be his personal representative at the funeral. In attendance were the diplomatic corps accredited before the Syrian government; representatives from the government; the army and the internal security; the entire Syrian hierarchy; a representative from Ecumenical Patriarch Athénagoras I; Syrian Orthodox Patriarch Jacob III in person; representatives of the Greek Orthodox patriarchate; the representative of the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem; as well as delegates from Protestant and Muslim communities; and an immense multitude of faithful. The homily was delivered by Bishop Joseph Tawil of Mira of the Melkites. At 8 p.m., on that same day, the body was taken in procession at the light of candles and deposited in the vault of the patriarchs and bishops, which had been built that year under the sacristy of the cathedral. Three years later, according to his will, his remains were transferred to and buried in a tomb that he had built in the mother house of the Sœurs de Notre-Dame du Perpétuel Secours in Daroun-Harissa, Lebanon.

(1) In March 1946, the Russian authorities organized a fake "sobor" (formal gathering or council of bishops, church officials, and monastic and lay representatives morally representing the whole particular church and dealing with matters of faith, morality, rite, and canonical and cultural life) in Lviv, which was attended, under coercion, by some priests and faithful, but without a single member of the episcopate of the Ukrainian Catholic Church. This "sobor" declared annulled the decision of the Sobor of Brest of 1596, which had declared the union of the Ukrainian Catholic Church with Rome, and also "united" the Ukrainian Catholic Church with the Russian Orthodox Church.
(2) From Central Siberia, the metropolitan corresponded clandestinely with ecclesiastical and lay faithful of the Catholic Church, wrote pastoral letters and issued directives to Ukrainian Catholic priests who were scattered throughout Siberia, the Urals and Kazakhistan.
(3) In 1957, on the 40th anniversary of his priesthood, Pope Pius XII sent Metropolitan Slipyj a personally written letter giving him his blessing; the letter did not reach its destination but instead gave the public prosecutor an opportunity to accuse the prelate of links with the pope and as a result, he was again brought to trial in 1958 and sentenced to further time of forced labor.
(4) The second site linked above indicates that he had been secretly created cardinal in 1949. The sites: To Pray Again as a Catholic: The Renewal of Catholicism in Western Ukraine, note 12; Years of Imprisonment Could Not Break Slipyj's Indomitable Fidelity; and Cardinal Joseph Slipyj (1892-1984) an Imitation of Christ, section Exile and Prophet : A granite formation; and the book Josyf Cardinale Slipyj, 1892-1984 : una Imitazione di Cristo, p. 12, say that he was created cardinal and reserved in pectore by Pope John XXIII in 1960. The pope died without publishing his name.

He returned to Prague immediately. President Edvard Beneš of Czechoslovakia decorated him with the Iron Cross and the medal of Hero of the Resistance, two of the highest honors of the nation.
Episcopate. Elected archbishop of Prague, Czechoslovakia, November 4, 1946. Consecrated, December 8, 1946, metropolitan cathedral of St. Vitus, Prague, by Saverio Ritter, titular archbishop of Egina, nuncio in Czechoslovakia, assisted by Maurice Picha, bishop of Hradec Králové, and by Anton Eltschkner, titular bishop of Zephirio, auxiliary of Prague. His episcopal motto was Eucharistia et labor. Imprisoned by the Communist regime of Czechoslovakia, 1949-1963; from June 19, 1949 to March 7, 1951, he was practically locked up at the former archiepiscopal residence; then, on March 10, he was taken away from Prague; for many years nobody in the world, including the Vatican, knew where the archbishop was being kept. It was widely believed that Archbishop Beran was one of the three prelates created cardinal and reserved in pectore by Pope John XXIII in the consistory of March 28, 1960, but the pope died in 1963, without ever publishing their names. After having been transferred to government installations, first at a villa near Liberec, then to Msitevec, near Horice, and from there to Padebenice, he was taken to Mukarov, near Prague, on October 4, 1963. Freed but impeded from exercising the episcopal ministry, 1963-1965. In late 1964, negotiations were conducted between the Vatican and the Czech government, which resulted in the appointment of new bishops, the appointment of an apostolic administrator for the metropolitan see of Prague, and the exile to Rome of Archbishop Beran; the latter occurred in February 1965.
Cardinalate. Created cardinal priest in the consistory of February 22, 1965; received the red biretta and the title of S. Croce in via Flaminia, February 25, 1965. Took up residence in Rome. Attended the last session of the Second Vatican Council, 1965. He offered his resignation from the pastoral government of the archdiocese several times but the pope did not accept it. When Pope Paul VI learned of the cardinal's precarious health condition, he hurried to his deathbed from the Vatican, but the cardinal had died only a few minutes before the pontiff reached his bedside.
Death. May 17, 1969, of lung cancer, Rome. Buried in the grotto of the patriarchal Vatican basilica because the Czech government did not allow the transportation of his body to that country. He is buried near where the tomb of Pope John XXIII was then. He is the only citizen of what is now the Czech Republic to receive this honor.
Beatification. The diocesan process for his beatification was initiated in the hall of the archiepiscopal palace in Prague on April 2, 1998. The ceremony was presided over by Cardinal Miloslav Vlk, archbishop of Prague, in the presence of Archbishop Giovanni Coppa, apostolic nuncio in the Czech Republic.

GUARDINI, Romano
(1885-1968)
Birth. February 17, 1885, Verona, Italy. Son of Romano Tullo Guardini and Paolo Maria Bernardinella. His baptismal name was Romano Michele Antonio Maria. He had three brothers, Gino, Mario and Aleardo. In 1886, the family moved to Mainz, Germany.
Education. Gymnasium of Mainz (graduated in August 1903; humanities); studied chemistry and then economics in Tübingen, Münich, and Berlin, 1903-1905; in August 1905, he experienced a religious conversion and the following November decided to study for the priesthood; studied theology in Freiburg, Tübingen, and Mainz, 1906-1910; doctoral studies at the University of Freiburg, October 1912 (obtained a doctoral degree in May 1915; dissertation: Die Lehre des heiligen Bonaventura von der Erlösung; it was published in 1922); studies for his "Habilitation" in Bonn, 1920.
Priesthood. Ordained, May 28, 1910, by Georg Heinrich Kirstein, bishop of Mainz. He celebrated his first mass the next day in the Abbey of Beuron with the chalice given to him by his parents as a present for his ordination. Curate in the diocese of Mainz, 1910-1912. Further studies, Freiburg, 1912-1915. Became a German citizen in 1911. Curate in the diocese of Mainz and chaplain to "Iuventus", 1915-1920. His father died in September 1919 and his mother and brothers moved to Lake Como and eventually to Isola Vicentina. Further studies, Bonn, 1920; in Easter of that year, he attended a meeting of the youth movement "Quickborn" in Burg Rothenfels. In 1923, he began to teach "Religionsphilosophie und Katholische Weltanschauung" at the University of Berlin. Together with Josef Aussem, became co-editor of Die Schildgenossen in 1924. In 1927, he became the national leader of "Quickborn" and the spiritual leader at Burg Rothenfels. Preacher at St. Benedict chapel in Berlin, 1928-1942. In February 1939, he was dismissed by the Third Reich from his professorship; and in August, the SS seized Burg Rothenfels and the Reich disbanded "Quickborn". From 1939 to 1943, he remained in Berlin, continued to write, and lectured at St. Canisius church. In 1941, the Reich suppressed Die Schildgenossen and prohibited Fr. Guardini from giving public addresses. From 1943 to 1945, he resided in Mooshausen with Fr. Josef Weiger. From 1945 to 1947, he was professor of "Religionsphilosophie und Christliche Weltanschauung" at the University of Tübingen; and 1948 to 1963, taught the same subject at the University of Münich; also, during those years, he preached every Sunday at St. Ludwig's church. On February 21, 1952, Pope Pius XII named him domestic prelate. That same year, he was awarded the Peace Prize of the German Book Association. In 1954, he was awarded an honorary doctorate in philosophy by the University of Freiburg. He was received into the Peace Society of the Order "Pour le Mérite" in 1958. The following year, 1959, he was awarded the Medal of Distinguished Service by the West German government; and in 1962, the "Erasmus Prize". In the Fall 1959, he had to stop teaching at the University of Münich because of bad health; in 1963, he retired from the university. The University of Padua awarded him an honorary degree in 1965.
Cardinalate. According to numerous sources, Pope Paul VI offered him the promotion to the cardinalate in 1965 but he declined. He wrote more than 75 books and 100 articles in theology, divine revelation, Jesus Christ as mediator, liturgy, history of the church, religious literature, Nazism and the Christian acceptance of modernity. Respected theologians like Karl Rahner, S.J.; Hans Urs von Balthasar, quasi cardinal; and Joseph Ratzinger, later Pope Benedict XVI, have acknowledged his influence over their theological formation and thought. From 1965 to 1968, he had to be hospitalized several times.
Death. October 1, 1968, of a cerebral hemorrhage, in a hospital in Münich. Cardinal Julius Döpfner, archbishop of Münich und Freising, presided the funeral mass on October 4, 1968 at St. Ludwig church, Münich. After the funeral, he was buried in the small cemetery of the Oratorians in the church of St. Laurentius in Münich-Nymphenburg. In 1969, he was awarded posthumously an honorary doctorate in philosophy by the University of Bologna and in 1970, the Katholische Akademie in Bayern established the "Guardini Prize", whose early recipients were Karl Rahner in 1970; Hans Urs von Balthasar in 1971; Oswald Nell-Breuning in 1972; and Werner Heisenberg in 1973. In 1997, his remains were transferred to a side chapel beside the altar of that church; his name and a cross mark his final resting place.

Abstract: This book collects a fascinating series of letters written by theologian-philosopher Romano Guardini in the mid-1920s in which he works out for the first time his sense of the challenges of humanity in a culture increasingly dominated by the machine. With prophetic clarity and unsettling farsightedness, Guardini's letters poignantly capture the personal implications and social challenges of living in the technological age - concerns that have now come to fruition seventy years after they were first raised; Guardini, Romano.

Exmo Revmo Dom Orani João Tempesta
Arcebispo de São Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro

Recebi a triste notmcia do falecimento do Venerado Cardeal Eugenio de Araujo Sales, depois de uma longa vida de dedicagão à Igreja no Brasil, venho exprimir meus pêsames a si e aos bispos auxiliares, ao clero e comunidades religiosas, aos fiéis da Arquidiocese de São Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro, que por três décadas teve nele um intrépido pastor, revelando-se autêntica testemunha do Evangelho no meio do seu povo.
Dou graças ao Senhor por ter dado à Igreja tão generoso pastor que, nos seus setenta anos de sacerdócio e cinquenta e oito de episcopado, procurou apontar a todos a senda da verdade na caridade e do serviço à comunidade, em permanente atengão pelos mais desfavorecidos, na fidelidade ao seu lema episcopal: Impendam et superimpendar (gastarei e gastar-me-ei por inteiro por vós).
Enquanto elevo fervorosas preces para que Deus acolha na sua felicidade eterna este seu servo bom e fiel, envio a essa comunidade arquidiocesana, que lamenta perda dessa admirada figura, à Igreja no Brasil, que nele sempre teve um seguro ponto de referência e de fidelidade à Sé Apostólica e a quantos tomam parte nos sufrágios animados pela esperança da ressurreigão, uma confortadora bênção apostólica.

After the assassination of Schutzstaffel (SS) leader Reinhard Heydrich on June 4, 1942, the Gestapo and SS hunted down and murdered the Czech agents, resistance members, and anyone suspected of being involved in Heydrich's death, totaling over 1000 persons. Fr. Trochta was seized by the Gestapo, subjected to a number of brutal interrogations at the Prague Gestapo headquarters, and at the Prague Pankrac prison and subsequently deported to the Terezin concentration camp. From there, he was transferred to the Mauthausen extermination camp, but, by almost a miracle, he managed to escape, though wounded, from a death transport. Having being returned to camp, he was transferred to the Dachau concentration camp in December 1944, from where he was liberated by United Sates troops.
Episcopate. Elected bishop of Litoměřice, September 27, 1947. Consecrated, November 16, 1947, Prague, by Xavier Ritter, titular archbishop of Aegina, nuncio in Czechoslovakia, assisted by Josef Beran, archbishop of Prague, and by Maurizio Picha, bishop of Hradec Králové. His episcopal motto was Actio sacrificum caritas. Impeded from exercising his pastoral ministry by the Communist regime, 1949-1968. In January 1953, he was arrested by the State Security Service, and, in July 1954, he was sentenced to twenty five years imprisonment on concocted charges of "espionage" and "anti-state activities." In June I960, Bishop Trochta was amnestied, but was not allowed to resume his clerical duties. For several years, he worked as a construction laborer, and then a plumber, doing such jobs as repairing toilets. After having suffered a stroke, he was allowed to retire to a home for priests, first in Tabor, and then in Radvanov. On July 20, 1968, at the time of the Prague Spring, the Supreme Court of Czechoslovakia struck down Bishop Trochta's sentence as a violation of legality, and on August 6, 1968, he resumed his office as residential bishop of Litoměřice.
Cardinalate. Created cardinal priest and reserved in pectore in the consistory of April 28, 1969; published in the consistory of March 5, 1973; received the red biretta and the title of S. Giovanni Bosco in via Tuscolana, deaconry elevated pro illa vice to title, April 12, 1973. At the time, he said he had not aspired to that office, but had not turned it down out of respect for the pope's wish. Attended the First Extraordinary Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, Vatican City, October 11 to 28, 1969; and the Second Ordinary Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, Vatican City, September 30 to November 6, 1971. His last public ceremony was the March 1973 consecration of three bishops in Slovakia, and one in Moravia.
Death. April 6, 1974, Litoměřice; he suffered a stroke in the morning, was taken to a hospital, and died without having recovered consciousness. Buried in the bishops' tomb in the city cemetery of Litoměřice (1).
Beatification. The diocese of Litoměřice and Salesians Fathers are gathering all the necessary documents to start the beatification process of Cardinal Trochta.

(1) According to Wilhelm von Tacke's article Ein Zeuge der vatikanischen Ostpolitik Erst in der rumänischen Untergrundkirche, dann zwölf Jahre in Gefängnissen - Zum Tode von Prälat Hieronymus Menges, Die Tagespost, no. 59, May 16, 2002, on February 22, 1969, Pope Paul VI granted a private audience to Msgr. Hieronymus Menges, who probably was one of the last living witnesses of the Vatican's Ostpolitik under Popes Pius XII to Paul VI. During the audience, Msgr. Menges asked the pope to encourage the Romanian faithful and to give them a sign that they are not forgotten. When the pope asked "What?" the monsignor recommended to the pope that the Byzantine Romanian Bishop Juliu Hossu of Cluj-Gherla and Áron Márton, Latin Bishop of Alba Julia, be appointed cardinals; and to reward a few distinguished priests with the title of monsignor. Archbishop Agostino Casaroli, secretary of the S.C. for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs and main conductor of the Vatican Ostpolitik, sent his secretary to Romania and asked the Ministry of Culture in Bucharest whether the state would accept the double promotion. The ministry agreed to the promotion of Latin Bishop Márton but not to the one of Byzantine Romanian Bishop Hossu. Bishop Márton refused the promotion when he heard that the Romanian government had rejected Bishop Hossu's cardinalitial creation. As a result, Bishop Hossu became cardinal in pectore and Bishop Márton, now a Servant of God, never received the red hat. Bishop Márton's biography in Wikipedia says that "in 1945, after the death of Cardinal Jusztinián Serédi, Pope Pius XII wanted Bishop Márton to become the next cardinal in Hungary, but, as the Hungarian Communist Party strongly opposed him, József Mindszenty was chosen for the position."

Penso altresì al generoso servizio da lui reso alla Parola di Dio, mediante la predicazione di giornate di spiritualità al clero e ai giovani, come pure il fervido impegno nell'attuazione di un autentico spirito liturgico. Elevo fervide preghiere al Signore affinché, per intercessione della Beata Vergine Maria, accolga questo suo fedele servitore e insigne Pastore nella celeste Gerusalemme, e di cuore imparto a quanti ne piangono la scomparsa la confortatrice benedizione apostolica.

(1) It is believed that in 1969, Pope Paul VI, an admirer of de Father de Lubac's works, had proposed making him a cardinal, but that Father de Lubac demurred, believing that Pope John XXIII's 1962 requirement that all cardinals be bishops was "an abuse of an apostolic office". Paul VI instead elevated Father de Lubac's junior colleague Father Jean Daniélou, S.J., in that consistory, having committed to grant the cardinalate to a Jesuit theologian. In 1983 Pope John Paul II offered Father de Lubac the cardinalate, this time with a dispensation from being consecrated a bishop. At 87, de Lubac accepted.

Marco, to Cardinal Giuseppe Sarto, patriarch of Venice, future pope Pius X and saint, while she was expecting Pietro, and the cardinal blessed the baby. The mother always said that the priestly vocation of Pietro was born on that day because she had offered her son before the patriarch to God.

Al Signor Cardinale Agostino Vallini
Piazza San Giovanni Laterano, 4
00184 Roma

La scomparsa del venerato Cardinale Giovanni Canestri, oriundo della diocesi di Alessandria e appartenente al clero di Roma, suscita nel mio animo profonda commozione e sincera ammirazione per uno stimato uomo di Chiesa, che visse con umiltà e fedeltà il suo lungo e fecondo sacerdozio ed episcopato a servicio del Vangelo e delle anime lui affidate. Ricordo con gratitudine il suo fervido ministero dapprima come viceparroco, negli anni duri della guerra, nelle periferie romane segnate da sofferenze e povertà; poi come parroco in due popolose borgate, intento ad educare specialmente i giovani alla gioia della fede. Nominato vescovo ausiliare di Roma si dedicò con intensità apostolica alle esigenze spirituali e materiali della gente, mentre partecipava assiduamente ai lavori del concilio Vaticano secondo. Nel ministero episcopale a Tortona, in seguito come Vicegerente e poi Arcivescovo di Cagliari e infine di Genova-Bobbio ha testimoniato saggezza pastorale, generosa attenzione alle necessità degli altri, andando incontro a tutti con bontà e mansuetudine. Innalzo fervide preghiere di suffragio perché il Signore accolga il compianto porporato nel gaudio e nella pace eterna, ed invio a Lei e a quanti condividono il dolore per la sua dipartita la confortatrice benedizione apostolica, con un pensiero speciale per le Suore Apostole del Sacro Cuore di Gesù che lo hanno amorevolmente assistito specialmente in questi ultimi anni di infermità.

(103) 18. KOREC, S.J., Ján Chryzostom
(1924-
Birth. January 22, 1924, Bošany, diocese of Nitra, Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia). Third child of Jan Korec, a tannery worker, and Mária Drábic.
Education. Initial studies at the public school of Bošany and town school of Chyronary, a nearby village. In his youth he was an active Boy Scout. Decided to become a priest and entered the Society of Jesus on September 15, 1939. Jesuit center in Ružomberok (high school); graduated from high school in 1944 in Kláštor pod Znievom; went to Trnava to study philosophy; a year later, he went to Brno to continue his philosophical studies; after two years, he returned to Trnava to study theology; besides studying, he assisted in the publication of books and the religious magazines "Posol" and "Katolícke misie". He and other older Jesuits prepared a miscellany entitled "Veobecná Cirkev - šstúium viery, vedy a umenia" (The Universal Church - Studies in Religion, Science, and the Arts); in the miscellany, two of his works would be published (one of them, "The Philosophical Principles of Dialectic Materialism", was his licentiate thesis in 1947); after the Communist coup in Czechoslovakia in 1948, his works were removed from the miscellany and his thesis had to be published elsewhere. On April 13, 1950, "Barbarian Night", raids against monasteries and religious houses took place and all were closed; he had to interrupt his theological studies when the religious orders were suppressed; he had been exempted from military conscription because of a heart defect and, therefore, he was not forced to join the labor division "PTP" (forced hard labor); instead, he was confined in Jasov; and later in Pezinok; after five months, he was released.
Priesthood. Ordained, in secret, October 1, 1950, Roznava, by Robert Pobozný, titular bishop of Neila, vicar capitular of Roznava. In his civilian life, he worked as a manual laborer in Mototechna in Nitra and conducted his pastoral ministry in secret; he then went to Bratislava, where he ministered in Priemstav and Tatrachema. By 1951, most of the bishops of the country had been jailed and sentenced to long prison terms. In view of this situation, the Holy See decided to consecrate bishops in secret to assure the existence of the Church.
Episcopate. Named bishop (no formal election because he was secretly appointed and consecrated). Consecrated, August 24, 1951, Bratislava, secretly, by Pavol Hnilica, S.J., also a clandestine bishop, without co-consecrators. At 27, he was the youngest bishop in the world. His episcopal motto is Ut omnes unum sint. While performing his episcopal ministry, he worked in a chemical factory; and later, in 1954, he was a laboratory technician at the Institute of Labor Hygiene, where he later became the librarian; an inspectional raid forced him out of that position; the authorities found him "not good enough" to work; finally, he was allowed to work as a night security guard at Prefa; one year later, he was moved to the chemical complex of Dimitrovka. On January 21, 1960, the ŠtB police searched his house; shortly after, he was removed from his job and taken to the police headquarters "Februárka"; and later, arrested. In May 1960, he was convicted of treason and tried with other Jesuits; he was sentenced to 12 years in prison. Freed and rehabilitated on February 28, 1968, during the period of renewal, the Prague Spring, initiated by Alexander Dubček; he returned to Bratislava and assumed a public and religious life trying to restore broken ties; he tried to go to Pezinok to work as a spiritual leader in the Charity house but the authorities did not allow him; he had to accept a job in the Cooperative of the Disabled; later, he worked as a laborer in the Recreational Services of Bratislava, specifically, gardening. Because of pulmonary tuberculosis, diagnosed at the Medical Faculty, he had to leave his job; on July 15, 1968, he began treatment at the hospital of Podunajské Biskupice; and in February 1969, in the High Tatras. While he was in the hospital, the forces of the Warsaw Pact entered Czechoslovakia and put an end to the process of renewal. Nevertheless, on June 24, 1969, Bishop Korec was judicially rehabilitated. When his health improved, he was allowed to go to Rome. On July 9, 1969, he had a private audience with Pope Paul VI; this constituted an unforgettable experience in his life; the pope bestowed on him an episcopal ring and a pectoral cross as well as a crosier and two mitres, which the pontiff had used as archbishop of Milan. Hard times had begun again for his country after the Soviet occupation and especially for him because he was no longer a secret bishop. He was not allowed to perform his episcopal ministry and had to stay at the Children's Hospital in Bratislava, which was staffed by the Sisters of the Most Holy Savior. He was constantly under the vigilance of the ŠtB. On November 5, 1974, the state consented that he needed to to assist the sisters spiritually and he had to go again to work at the chemical factory Tatrachema. His rehabilitation was annulled in that same year and he was sent to prison for 4 years to complete his sentence; freed for poor health, he lost the job that he had held before as street sweeper and went back to work at Tatrachema. On July 1, 1979, because of serious health problems, he left the chemical factory and went to work as an elevator serviceman. From May 1980, he was forced to work in a carpenter's workroom and kept under strict supervision. Two years later, in 1982, at 58 years of age, he retired because of his health condition. The ŠtB followed his every move and even broke into his apartment; as he was not a secret bishop, his popularity and following grew considerably, which made the police machinery increase its vigilance; the police wiretapped and tried to defame him but he continued his ministry and writing. On May 18, 1986, he received an honorary doctor of law degree from Notre Dame University, Indiana, United States of America. During the Marian Year, 1987-1987, pilgrimages of thousands of faithful took place throughout Slovakia; at Nitra Calvary, 150,000 pilgrims gathered and Bishop Korec was with them until summoned to an interrogation by the ŠtB. On March 25, 1988, during the "Good Friday of Bratislava", a gathering of faithfuls who prayed for religious freedom and human rights, the security forces attacked them, injured and imprisoned them; Bishop Korec was called to an interrogation and thus prevented from taking part in the meeting. On the following September 17, the bishop was prevented from participating in the pilgrimage in Šaštin. On April 27, 1989, Bishop Korec responded in writing to an antirreligious film series presented on national TV, "The Cross in the Toils of Power"; the ŠtB summoned him to an interrogation and tried to break into his apartment. In November 1989, the Communist regime was finally toppled in Czechoslovakia. He was rector of the seminary at the Cyril and Methodius Theological Faculty of Comenius University in Bratislava from January 2 to February 6, 1990. He was nominated bishop of Nitra on February 6, 1990. President of the Regional Episcopal Conference of Slovakia from April 23, 1990 to May 4, 1993.

President François Mitterand of France bestowed on him the badge of the Legion d'Honneur on July 3, 1993. On November 12, 1993, The Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C., United States of America, granted him an honorary doctorate of Humane Letters. On December 6, 1994, Matica Slovenská, Martin, awarded him the "Štefan Moyses Award". On August 31, 1995, President Michal Kováč of the Slovak Republic granted him the badge of L'udovít Štúr. On October 24, 1997, he was awarded the Commemorative Medal of Štefan Moyzes (200th anniversary) by Matica Slovenská, Martin. On December 10, 1997, the Slovak National Center for Human Rights, Bratislava, awarded him the "Saver Medal for the Development and Defense of Human Rights". On March 12, 1998, the University of Constantine the Philosopher, Nitra, awarded him a doctorate honoris causa.

(1) On January 18, 1995, he sent a letter to the faithful announcing his resignation. This is a fragment of the letter, taken from Le Cardinal Henri Schwery, prêtre, évêque, cardinal. Un quart desiècle dépiscopat:
Chers diocésains, frères et soeurs,
Après longue et mure réflexion, ayant sollicité conseils et remarques, et m'étant confié à Dieu dans la prière, j'ai jugé bon de prier le Saint Père d'accepter ma demission comme éveque de Sion afin qu'il puisse confier notre diocese à un Pasteur dynamique et avisé. Le Saint Père a accepté ma démission. Elle entrera en viguer avec la prise de possession du diocese par mon successeur.
Parmi les raisons de cette décision, il convient de mentionner la fatigue, ainsi qu'une détérioration progressive de ma santé. Par ailleurs, au cours de ma 18ème année d'épiscopat, je mesure d'autant mieux l'opportunité d'un renuovellement à fréquence raisonnable des Pasteurs diocésains. La rapidité de l'évolution sociale et la nécessaire adaptation de la Pastorale semblent exiger tuojours davantage que les Eglises diocésaines prennent des élans renouvelés, sous des impulsions nouvelles inspirées par de nouveaux éveques.

(1) For virtually all the 30 years of his episcopate in the Diocese of Bac Ninh (except the last four), he was forced to stay at home without ever being able to make pastoral visits to the more than 100 parishes in his ecclesiastical territory. With only three priests in all, and restricted in his movements and means of communication, during his years of 'house arrest', the Bishop started to write the whole of Jesus' life as it is told in the Gospels, the Christian doctrine, the commandments of God and of the Church, and the sacraments in the 'luc-bat' poetic form (stanzas of six or eight words). The cadence of the composition helps people learn them quickly. He formed councils of lay people in the parishes, their number varying according to the importance of the parishes, to be responsible for the continuation of religious life in the local communities and provide a three-year marriage course for the young people. Another initiative promoted by the former Bishop Phạm Ðình Tụng was the foundation of a secular institute for boys and girls for the purpose of training them as catechists. The initiative has had excellent results and these young catechists, traveling all over the country guaranteeing catechetical courses everywhere, especially to children, have been very fruitful.

Ho appreso con dolore la mesta notizia della morte del Signor Cardinale Ersilio Tonini, Arcivescovo emerito di Ravenna-Cervia, e nell'elevare fervide preghiere a Dio perché conceda il riposo eterno a questo zelante e generoso Pastore, mi unisco spiritualmente al cordoglio di codesta comunità diocesana dove egli esercitò con sollecitudine il ministero episcopale.

The body laid in repose in the parish of the Holy Family. Three requiem masses were celebrated every day in the funeral chapel. The Straits Exchange Foundation, which handles Taiwan-China affairs in the absence of official ties, said the government contacted Cardinal Shan's family in China and helping to arrange their trip to attend the funeral.

In accordance with the late cardinal's wishes, the chapel was simply decorated with candles and crucifixes, and flower bouquets were not accepted. Cardinal Shan had said in his will that as he took a vow of poverty throughout his life, his departure from this world should not be in any sense luxurious. The relatives of the late cardinal from the Popular Republic of China were allowed to attend. President Ma Ying-jeou of Taiwan also attended the ceremony and paid tribute to Cardinal Shan's religious dedication.The cardinal said in his will that his funeral should be a simple affair, held "as the poor people would" and that the chapel should be decorated only with candles, the Bible and crucifixes, he added.

After the funeral, the body of the late cardinal was buried in the local Catholic cemetery in a simple coffin on a site no bigger than 1 ping (3.3 square meters) in compliance with his will. A foundation will be established in the cardinal's memory to assist the disadvantaged people to continue his dedication to Taiwan's less fortunate.

Innalzo fervide preghiere di suffragio perché il Signore accolga nel gaudio e nella pace eterna cosl zelante pastore, fedele al Vangelo e alla Chiesa, e invio a Vostra Eccellenza, all'intero presbiterio e a quanti condividono il dolore per la sua scomparsa la confortatrice Benedizione Apostolica.

En gage de réconfort, je vous adresse une particulière Bénédiction apostolique, ainsi qu'aux Évêques de Côte d'Ivoire, à la famille du Cardinal défunt et à ses proches, à ses anciens diocésains, et à toutes les personnes qui prendront part à la célébration des obséques.
