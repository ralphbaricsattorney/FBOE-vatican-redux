He belongs to the Romanian Greek Catholic rite.Education. He studied at the primary school in Ferneziu, from 1938 to 1944; later, from 1944 to 1948, in the lyceum Gheorghe Şincai. The education reform of 1948 prohibited all religions in the schools in the country; especially by Decree no. 358 of 1948 of the Grand National Assembly, the Romanian Greek Catholic Church, united with Rome, was brutally suppressed and declared illegal and because of this, Lucian's hope to train and become a priest became unachievable and he withdrew from school. Between 1948 and 1951, he attended woodworking school (fine furniture) in Baia Mare, and continued, part-time, his education to complete the lyceal studies. From 1951 to 1954, he did military service, which was compulsory at that time, in the aviation school in Turnişor (Sibiu). After finishing his military training, he was deployed to the jet aviation battalion in Craiova. In 1953, because of his belonging to the Romanian Greek Catholic Church, he was considered an undesirable person and transferred from the aviation battalion to work building the first hydroelectric plant of the country, in Bicaz. In 1954, he left Bicaz and waiting for an opportunity to study theology secretly, he worked in different places. At the suggestion of Bishop Julius Hossu and the blessing of Bishop Alexander Russu, at the proposal of Prof. Dr. Silviu Augustine Prunduş (released from prison in 1955), Bishop Iulia Marton Aron of Alba agreed to receive, as an exception, five young students, one for each diocese of the Romanian Greek Catholic Church, in the Institutul Teologic Romano-Catolic of Alba Iulia for the academic degree; among them was Lucian. In the fourth year of studies, the rector of the institute told him and the other student that remained from the original five, that they were expelled by the Department of Cults and that within 24 hours they were required to leave not only the Institute but also the city. In terms of ecclesiastical and canon laws there was no reason for expulsion. He returned to his native place. The expulsion coincided with the beginning of the persecution and prosecution by the Securitate. For a year he looked for work in mining companies and construction sites but was rejected on the grounds that he was a Catholic theologian. After a year, he managed to find a job as a laborer in the stone quarry in Ferneziu, where he worked for almost 10 years. When he was persecuted there, he transferred to the Department of Roads and Bridges, in the county of Maramureş, where he worked until his retirement in June 1990. Despite persecution, intimidation and threats, he did not give up his dream of becoming a priest, continuing underground studies, with former teachers from the theological academy who were fugitives. All underground students took their licensing exam. In 1964, a pardon decree was issued and the bishops were released from prison. Then his dream was fulfilled.",twenty_first_century,fiu_scrape

The education reform of 1948 prohibited all religions in the schools in the country; especially by Decree no. 358 of 1948 of the Grand National Assembly, the Romanian Greek Catholic Church, united with Rome, was brutally suppressed and declared illegal and because of this, Lucian's hope to train and become a priest became unachievable and he withdrew from school. Between 1948 and 1951, he attended woodworking school (fine furniture) in Baia Mare, and continued, part-time, his education to complete the lyceal studies. From 1951 to 1954, he did military service, which was compulsory at that time, in the aviation school in Turnişor (Sibiu). After finishing his military training, he was deployed to the jet aviation battalion in Craiova. In 1953, because of his belonging to the Romanian Greek Catholic Church, he was considered an undesirable person and transferred from the aviation battalion to work building the first hydroelectric plant of the country, in Bicaz. In 1954, he left Bicaz and waiting for an opportunity to study theology secretly, he worked in different places. At the suggestion of Bishop Julius Hossu and the blessing of Bishop Alexander Russu, at the proposal of Prof. Dr. Silviu Augustine Prunduş (released from prison in 1955), Bishop Iulia Marton Aron of Alba agreed to receive, as an exception, five young, one for each diocese of the Romanian Greek Catholic Church, in the Institutul Teologic Romano-Catolic of Alba Iulia for the academic degree; among them was Lucian. In the fourth year of studies, the rector of the institute told him and the other student that remained from the original five, that they were expelled by the Department of Cults and that within 24 hours they were required to leave not only the Institute but also the city. In terms of ecclesiastical and canon laws there was no reason for expulsion. He returned to his native place. The expulsion coincided with the beginning of the persecution and prosecution by the Securitate. For a year he looked for work in mining companies and construction sites but was rejected on the grounds that he was a Catholic theologian. After a year, he managed to find a job as a laborer in the stone quarry in Ferneziu, where he works almost 10 years. When he was persecuted there, he transferred to the Department of Roads and Bridges, in the county of Maramureş, where he worked until his retirement in June 1990. Despite persecution, intimidation and threats, he did not give up his dream of becoming a priest, continuing underground studies, with former teachers from the theological academy who were fugitives. All underground students took their licensing exam. In 1964, a pardon decree was issued and the bishops were released from prison. Then his dream was fulfilled.",twenty_first_century,fiu_scrape

Lorenzo was the son of Jacopo Salviati and Lucrezia de’ Medici, sister of Pope Leo X; Costanza Conti, was the only daughter of Giovambattista Conti and Ginevra della Mirandola, sister of the famous humanist Giovanni Pico della Mirandola.

In 1552, Gian Battista and Antonmaria - aged seventeen and fifteen respectively - lived in Palazzo Della Rovere, the cardinal's residence, where they were probably initiated into Greek and Latin letters by literati in the service of their uncle. According to the inventory of his library, Antonmaria cultivated a love for letters throughout his life, becoming particularly passionate about history, as can be seen on several occasions, starting from 1572, in his diplomatic correspondence. It is more than likely that as early as 1558 - at the age of twenty-one - he spent a first stay in Padua to study law. He returned there from 1563 to 1565 in the company of a certain Doctor Mazzinghi, whom his uncle, Cardinal Bernardo, had assigned him as a tutor. In the meantime, his uncle, as persuaded as his brother Giovanni before him, that this nephew should become the third Cardinal Salviati, began to prepare the way for him that would lead him to the Sacred College of Cardinals.",sixteenth_century,fiu_scrape
